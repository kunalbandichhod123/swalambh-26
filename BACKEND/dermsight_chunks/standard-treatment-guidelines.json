Essential Medicines List (EML) and the Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG) are an\nimportant component of promoting rational use of medicines. Gujarat Medical Service\nCorporation Limited under the auspices of Department of Health & Family Welfare,\nGovernment of Gujarat finalizes EML and has undertaken the task to develop STG for the\nState. The objective is to improve the availability of quality drugs at each health facility and\nto achieve maximum public health improvement using available resources. B. J. Medical\nCollege & Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad has been instrumental in the preparation of the STG. An attempt has been made in this manual to provide guidelines for the treatment of common\ndiseases, keeping in mind the rational use of medicines. It is a blend of evidence from\nstandard text and reference books with consensus of specialists. The guidelines are\ncomprehensive, concise and seek to summarize treatment plan for patients with priority\ndiseases.",

It is a blend of evidence from\nstandard text and reference books with consensus of specialists. The guidelines are\ncomprehensive, concise and seek to summarize treatment plan for patients with priority\ndiseases. It is assumed that the patient has been fully evaluated and all co-morbidities\nidentified. Under each clinical condition, the treatment plan has been suggested that can be\napplied to average patient with common presentation. However, there may be great variations\nin patient presentation, their family history, treatment preferences and tolerance for different\nside effect. Therefore, these guidelines can be viewed as an expert consultation and weighed\nwith respect to other information. Moreover, the recommendations do not replace clinical\njudgment nor encroach on clinical flexibility, which must be tailored to the particular needs\nof each clinical situation. A large number of experienced clinicians have contributed in the preparation of these\nguidelines. The manual begins with a brief introduction to the concept of Rational Use of\nMedicines along with its important components.",

ADRs are therefore\n unwanted or unintended effects of a medicine, including idiosyncratic effects, which\n occur during its proper use. An adverse drug event (ADE) is defined as ‘Any untoward medical occurrence that may\n present during treatment with a medicine but which does not necessarily have a causal\n relationship with this treatment’. Two types of ADRs and their differentiating characteristics have been identified. The\n common, predictable, dose related reaction with low mortality is type ‘A’ ADR. For\n example, anticholinergic effect of tricyclic antidepressants and digoxin toxicity. ADRs\n may also be unrelated to the known pharmacological action of a drug. These are\n uncommon, non-dose related bizarre ‘B’ type reactions, for example, anaphylaxis with\n penicillins, malignant hyperthermia with halothane. Thalidomide marked the first recognized public health disaster related to the\n introduction of a new drug. It is now recognized that clinical trials, however through,\n cannot be guaranteed to detect all adverse effects likely to be caused by a drug.

The lesions of the\n spinal cord may be compressive or non-compressive. Pharmacological treatment\n The treatment depends on the underlying etiology. E.g. compressive myelopathies usually\n require urgent surgical intervention.

The dose is Inj. methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3-5 days. Continuation of steroids depends on the underlying cause.

Pyrexia, cervical lymphadenopathy. Inflamed tonsils with exudates\n\nPharmacological treatment\n• Tab. paracetamol 500 mg 3-4 times a day for 5 days (children 10 kg/dose) or Tab. ibuprofen 400 mg - 600 mg 3 times a day for 5 days (children 10 mg/kg/dose.) • Cap. amoxicillin 500mg TDS for 5 days. Or Tab. erythromycin 500mg QID for 5-7\n\n CHRONIC TONSILLITIS\nChronic inflammation of tonsil starts as an acute inflammation. Minute abscesses get walled\nby chronic inflammation. It can be chronic parenchymatous or hypertrophic type tonsillitis. 166\nSalient features\n Tonsils are uniformly enlarged and congested. Chronic follicular tonsillitis shows beads of\n white discharge on surface of tonsil.",

Severe pain can prolong gastrointestinal ileus, urinary retention,\n impair respiratory movements producing atelectasis and predisposes to deep vein\n thrombosis due to immobilization. Various methods to alleviate postoperative pain are NSAIDs, opioids (intra muscular,\n transdermal or transmucosal), patient controlled analgesia, local infiltration of anaesthetic\n drugs, epidural analgesia and intrapleural analgesia. The method used depends upon the\n site and the magnitude of surgery done, severity of pain, whether the patient is allowed\n orally, facilities and expertise available. It is necessary to give analgesics by\n intramuscular or intravenous route in the immediate postoperative period and till the\n patient is able to accept orally.

For term babies, use 100% oxygen when baby is cyanotic or when positive pressure\n ventilation is required.

If\n supplemental oxygen is not available, positive pressure ventilation should be continued\n with room air. Infants without signs of life (no heart beat and no respiratory effort) after 10 minutes of\n resuscitation show either a high mortality or severe neurodevelopmental disability. After\n 10 minutes of continuous and adequate resuscitative efforts, discontinuation of\n resuscitation may be justified if there are no signs of life. Hypothermia\n Identification of hypothermia. An axillary (or rectal) temperature <36.0°C is\n hypothermia. Such a baby would feel cold to touch on the abdomen and periphery.

Provision of maintenance requirements for normal\nmetabolism, correction of ongoing losses (diarrhea, vomiting) or removal (suction,\naspiration). The maintenance requirements are as follows:\nA guideline for estimating daily fluid and electrolyte requirement in a normal child under\nnormal conditions is:\nWeight Fluid requirement\n3-10 kg 100 ml/kg/day\n10-20 kg 1000 ml + 50 ml/kg/day for each kg above 10. > 20 kg 1500 ml + 20 ml/kg/day for each kg above 20. Maintenance fluid requirement replaces water loss through skin (2/3 of losses), GIT,\nrespiration, and urine. These losses are affected by ambient humidity, clothing, body\ntemperature, respiratory rate, and age of the child. Situation specific adjustments are\nnecessary when calculating maintenance fluids.",

Severe malnutrition\n Initial treatment involves managing complications. The aim is to treat complications and\n stabilize the child. Severely wasted children and those with oedema need hospitalization. Other indications for\n admission in an undernourished child are severe dehydration, severe diarrhoea, hypothermia,\n shock, systemic infection, jaundice, bleeding, age less than one year, or persistent loss of\n appetite.
