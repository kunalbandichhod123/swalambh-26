Do they occur at the same sites or different sites? This is important\nif a diagnosis of urticaria or herpes simplex is being considered. Was the lesion caused by trauma/insect bite?

Sun exposure is often indicated by a rash on the face or back of the\nhands. The important question here is the time interval after sun\nexposure until the rash appears. In solar urticaria, the rash appears\nwithin five minutes of sun exposure and is gone within an hour; in\npolymorphic light eruption, the rash occurs several hours after sun\nexposure and lasts several days. Ask about irritants on the skin if the patient has hand eczema. Common irritants include detergents, oils and some solutions that\nare found in the workplace (hairdressers, dental workers). Are the hands in direct contact with irritants? What makes the skin condition better? What makes the skin condition worse?

What treatment has been used to date (medical, herbal and over\nthe counter (OTC))? 3 Pruritus (Itching)\nPruritus (itchy skin) is the single most common symptom of many\ninflammatory skin conditions (see section 06 for Pruritus). Dry skin itself\nis itchy and requires management with emollient therapies. While itching\nis distressing to the patient, it may not help you reach a diagnosis. Excoriation (scratch marks) on the skin provide evidence of pruritus. Severe itch, especially at night, may be caused by scabies (see section\n06 for Scabies). Management of pruritus is an essential component of\noverall management of the skin condition. 3 Past, family and social history\nPast history: Has the patient had the rash before and, if so, was\nit the same as now? If eczema is present, a history of infantile eczema, asthma or hayfever\nmay suggest a diagnosis of atopic eczema. Family history: Does anyone else in the family have a skin condition?",
