Skin is not an inert barrier but plays an active part\nin defending against insults (microbial, physical, and chemical) from the\nexternal environment. In this chapter, we aim to give you an insight into what your skin is\ndoing for you, in the hope that this will encourage you to care for the\nskin of your patients (and your own skin) with the respect it deserves. An\nunderstanding of cutaneous physiology will also help you to analyse what\nhas gone wrong or what might happen in patients with skin problems,\nincluding skin failure.",

We discuss the structure of the skin and consider how this finely tuned\norgan functions as a barrier (‘keeping the inside in and the outside out’)\nand reduces water loss, is part of the immune system, is a metabolic\norgan synthesizing vitamin D and cytokines, regulates body temperature, and senses noxious stimuli (skin on the tips of your fingers is particularly sensitive; see Box 1.1).

The psychological aspects of skin problems are discussed in more detail in E Chapter 28, pp. 570–1. Box 1.1 Dermatoglyphics (fingerprints)\n • Fingertips, palms, soles, and toes are covered with a pattern of\n epidermal ridges called dermatoglyphics. • The three basic patterns (loops, arches, and whorls) are unique to\n each individual. • Characteristic dermatoglyphic patterns accompany many\n chromosomal abnormalities. • The ridges amplify vibrations when your finger brushes across a\n rough surface. • The ridges enhance grip. • Autosomal dominant adermatoglyphia (SMARCAD1 mutation)—\n absence of epidermal ridges, also known as ‘immigration delay\n disease’.

Protection against ultraviolet damage\n• Melanin synthesized by melanocytes protects keratinocyte\n nuclei from harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation by\n absorbing and scattering rays and by scavenging free radicals\n (see E Chapter 16, pp. 320–1). • Enzymes repair UV-damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\n (see E Chapter 16, pp. 320–1).

Only small amounts of vitamin D are\n obtained from the diet. Vitamin D is required for calcium absorption\n and has essential roles in bone metabolism, neuromuscular function,\n and immune function. Deficiency can lead to rickets (in children),\n osteomalacia, and osteoporosis (see E Chapter 16, pp. 319–39).

Box 1.4 Skin colour\n • The colour of normal skin comes from a mixture of pigments, but\n melanin is the main contributor to skin colour. • Oxyhaemoglobin in blood gives untanned Caucasian skin a pink\n colour. • Carotene in subcutaneous fat and the horny layer of the epidermis\n adds a yellow hue to normal skin. • Abnormalities in skin colour may result from an imbalance of\n pigments (e.g. in cyanosis, chloasma, and carotenaemia) or the\n presence of abnormal pigments (e.g. haemosiderin). • Genetic abnormalities in the synthetic pathway of melanin present\n with abnormal skin colour.",

Dysmorphophobia and dermatological non-disease\nEach of us has a clear idea of how we look, but some individuals have a\ndistorted body image. Dysmorphophobia (body dysmorphic disorder) is a psychiatric condition in which patients have an unshakeable belief that they have a major\nflaw in their appearance. If present, the lesion is trivial, but some patients\nhave no visible pathology (dermatological non-disease). Most patients\nlack insight into their behaviour but want a dermatological answer to the\nintractable problem. Before diagnosing dysmorphophobia or dermatological non-disease, it\nis important to be clear what the patient is describing and what they are\ndoing to their skin, e.g. picking may scar the skin, hair plucking induces\nfolliculitis.

Angio-oedema implies oedema of the deep dermis, subcutaneous tissues, mucosa, and/or submucosa. Laryngeal oedema, which may cause\ndifficulty swallowing and respiratory obstruction, is life-threatening. Angio-oedema occurs in anaphylactic reactions. • Rarely, angiooedema is caused by C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (inherited—AD\ninheritance or acquired). These patients do not have urticaria. Angiooedema is usually triggered by mucosal trauma, e.g. dental procedures\nor, in ♀, sexual intercourse. Some patients complain of vomiting/abdominal pain. Prodromal features reported more commonly in women\ninclude fatigue, malaise, and short temper. α-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a rare cause (see E p. 462).

Search for the cause when you are taking the history, but remember\nthe commonest cause is deterioration of a pre-existing skin disorder or\ndrugs. Erythroderma may develop suddenly but, when associated with\nskin problems such as psoriasis, may evolve gradually. Causes include:\n• Dermatitis of any type, e.g. atopic, seborrhoeic, contact, stasis,\n asteatotic (15–40% of cases). • Psoriasis (8–25% of cases). • Drugs (10–28% of cases)—numerous drugs have been implicated. Also see Red man syndrome, E p. 372. • Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or leukaemia (15% of cases). • Rare skin diseases, e.g. pityriasis rubra pilaris, pemphigus foliaceus,\n ichthyosiform erythroderma (<1% of cases). In up to 30% of patients, erythroderma is classified as ‘idiopathic’, i.e. no\ncause found. Consider skin biopsy before prescribing treatments, such as\ntopical or oral corticosteroids, which will reduce inflammation and mask",

The tiny mites come\n out of follicles at night to walk around slowly (8–16cm/h) on the\n surface of the skin. They mate in the follicular openings. • Demodex are rare in children <5 years old. • Demodex are probably not pathogenic in immunocompetent\n humans. Increased numbers of mites are found in some\n papulopustular follicular eruptions, such as rosacea (see E p. 254)\n and acne, but their role in pathogenesis is controversial, and it is not\n clear if eradication is helpful. • Demodex infestation in immunocompromised patients with\n conditions, such as HIV/AIDS or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, may\n cause inflamed papular eruptions (demodicosis).",

Pathogenesis\nThe epidermis in psoriatic plaques is hyperproliferative, and the dermis\ncontains tortuous, dilated small blood vessels, as well as an inflammatory\ninfiltrate of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Neutrophils are present in some\nforms of psoriasis. Dendritic cells contribute to pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that an antigen penetrating a defective epidermal barrier stimulates an immune response, but, although innate and\nadaptive immunity seem to be activated, no antigen has been identified. Cytokines released by epidermal keratinocytes and activated T-cells\ndrive new vessel formation and proliferation of keratinocytes and T-cells.

Approach to management\nMost psoriasis is not life-threatening, but living with psoriasis can ruin\nlives. You are breaking bad news when you explain to someone that he/\nshe has psoriasis. Treatments offer control, rather than cure—psoriasis\nremits despite treatment, not because of treatment. Your assessment\nshould establish the impact of the disease, efficacy of previous treatments, and the extent of the disease. Managing psoriasis is an art—help\nthe patient to find a balance between living with psoriasis and living with\nproblems caused by treatment. For investigations, see Box 9.11. What should I do? • Do not make any assumptions—explore the patient’s expectations. Some patients are very bothered by limited disease.",

Reactive arthritis\n\nWhat is reactive arthritis? Reactive arthritis is a seronegative, HLA-B27-linked spondyloarthropathy that shares features with the other arthropathies in this group,\nincluding psoriatic arthritis (see E p. 206). Typically, patients (usually\nmen aged 20–40) have a mono- or oligoarthritis affecting the lower\nlimbs. Mucocutaneous signs are common. Arthritis develops several days to weeks after an extra-articular infection. Viable pathogen is not detected in the joint (though intra-articular\nbacteria or bacterial fragments have been identified). The common\ncauses of reactive arthritis are genitourinary infections (e.g. Chlamydia\ntrachomatis) and GI infections (e.g. Yersinia, Shigella, Salmonella, and\nCampylobacter). HIV infection is another cause. The triad of arthritis, a sterile (aseptic) urethritis, and conjunctivitis in a\npatient with dysentery was described by Reiter as a syndrome in 1916, and\nthe term Reiter syndrome is still used sometimes to describe this triad. What mucocutaneous signs should I look for? • Keratoderma blenorrhagicum: a pustular rash on palms and soles—\n clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from palmoplantar\n pustulosis.",

Obtain a measure of the overall intensity of\n the pain by asking the patient to grade the pain (mild, moderate, or\n severe) or rate the pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe). • When did the pain start, and how long does the pain last? • Has the pain changed?",

The sun emits a broad and continuous spectrum of electromagnetic\nenergy (the solar spectrum) (see Fig. 16.1). UVR is divided into short\n(UVC), medium (UVB), and long (UVA, ‘black light’) wavelength emissions. Ninety-eight percent of the UVR that reaches the earth’s surface\nis UVA. All UVC and a little UVB are absorbed in the atmosphere by the\nozone layer. UVB is absorbed by nucleic acids and proteins in the epidermis and stimulates the synthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Some\nUVA is absorbed in the epidermis, but UVA penetrates into the dermis. The damage caused by UVR depends on the duration of exposure, as\nwell as the skin phototype (see Table 16.1). • UVB causes immediate sunburn with painful erythema and, if\n severe, blistering. The UVB reaction peaks at 16–24h, then the skin\n desquamates over 2–3 days but becomes tanned and may develop\n solar lentigines (sunburn freckles). • UVR, particularly UVB, damages DNA, and cumulative damage\n causes skin cancer (see E p. 346).",

Androgens play a pivotal role in male\npattern hair loss, but their role in female pattern hair loss is less certain,\nand other mechanisms may be involved. Genetically determined susceptibility is important (prevalence varies in different populations). Male pattern hair loss—what should I look for? • About 25% of men begin to lose hair by age 30, and 50% by age 50. • Androgens cause follicular miniaturization, with progressive decrease\n in the width of the hair shaft. • Receding frontal hairline is common, particularly on the temples (may\n commence in the mid teens). • Gradual thinning of the hair on the vertex is eventually followed\n by complete loss of hair over the vertex (loss may be preceded by\n curling and coarsening of hair—acquired progressive kinking). • A rim of hair is retained around the back and sides of the scalp\n (occipital follicles are not dependent on androgens and are a source\n of follicles for hair transplants).

At least 20 different\nproteins can form the extracellular deposits of non-functional β-pleated\nsheets that typify amyloid fibrils.

Amyloid protein may be deposited in any tissue, including the kidney, GIT, heart, skin,\nmuscle, brain, and/or blood vessels. Accumulation of protein eventually\ncauses organ failure (often renal). Reactive systemic amyloidosis (AA) develops in association with\nchronic inflammation, including chronic infections, e.g. leprosy, TB, or\nosteomyelitis, and chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g. RA and ankylosing\nspondylitis.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare, but devastating, cutaneous fibrosing dermopathy seen in patients with end-stage kidney disease\nwho have been exposed to the gadolinium-based contrast agents used\nin MRI. Onset usually within 2–10 weeks of exposure. NSF may affect\nthe lungs, heart, liver, and muscles, as well as the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Complications, such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis,\npulmonary hypertension, and/or diaphragmatic paralysis, may be fatal\n(mortality rate 30%). Gadolinium is deposited in affected tissues. Circulating fibrocytes may\nbe involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, and certain factors increase\nthe risk of developing NSF (see Box 23.4). What should I ask? • Symptoms: progressive painful tightening of skin, leading to disabling\n joint contractures. Bone pain is common. • Has the patient been investigated by a contrast-enhanced MRI in\n previous weeks or months?",

Skin cancer in renal transplant\nrecipients\n Skin cancer, lymphoma/lymphoproliferative malignancies, and solid\norgan tumours are common in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and\nare a leading cause of death. By 5 years after transplantation, the risk\nof developing an SCC is 7100 times greater than in an immunocompetent patient. Most patients have multiple cancers. Pathogenesis of skin\ncancer is multifactorial (see Box 23.7). Risk relates to the level, as well\nas chronicity, of immunosuppression, e.g. patients who receive ciclosporin, prednisolone, and azathioprine have a three times higher risk of\nSCC than those taking prednisolone and azathioprine alone. Switch of\nimmunosuppressant drugs to mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus may\nreduce the risk of future cancers but risk compromising graft function.

Do blisters occur at sites of friction, e.g. feet? Or in heat? (Sweating may exacerbate EB; see E pp. 624–5). • Are mucosal surfaces affected? • Any post-inflammatory pigment, scarring, or milia? • Is there a family history of skin problems, e.g. maternal autoimmune\n blistering disease (IgG autoantibodies cross the placenta and may\n cause transient blisters in the neonate)?

Aim to address concerns\nand to educate (see Box 31.16), so that the child /family have the tools to\nmanage this distressing chronic disease. • Intractable itch/scratch. Relieve dryness, and control eczema. Protect skin from damage—suggest stroking or pinching skin to\n relieve itch; use occlusion. Therapeutic stories, in which the child is\n champion, may facilitate behavioural change, improve self-esteem,\n and help the child engage with treatment (overcoming ‘Evil Eric\n Eczema’). • Complaints that the skin ‘reacts to’/‘is allergic to’ emollients. Irritation of inflamed skin is much commoner than allergy. Ointments\n may be tolerated less well than creams. Suggest trying a creamy\n emollient on normal skin for a few days, before applying to\n eczematous skin.",

(see E inside back cover for diagram.) Alfred Blaschko was a dermatologist from Berlin who observed that\nepidermal naevi and some acquired skin diseases followed similar patterns: linear on the limbs, arcs on the chest, S-shapes on the abdomen,\nor V-shapes near the midline of the back. The patterns were not related\nto dermatomes (segments of skin defined by sensory innervations) or\nany known cause of linear skin markings such as Langer lines of cleavage,\naxial lines separating cranial and caudal dermatomes, lymphatic drainage,\nvascular flow, embryonic clefts, or pigmentary demarcation lines (see E\npp. 62–3).

How do I recognize cutaneous mosaicism? Five patterns have been described (see Fig. 32.1). The pattern is influenced by the pathway of migration of the affected cell, as well as other\nfactors such as the timing of the mutation:\n• Keratinocyte: Blaschko-linear pattern. Each clone of keratinocytes\n forms a continuous line, as the cells migrate outwards by directional\n proliferation following surface forces. • Melanoblast: block or phylloid but may be Blaschko-linear patterns. Melanoblasts migrate as single cells and proliferate locally in skin. • Nerve cells: dermatomal.

Box 34.4 Applying a paste bandage\n • Paste bandages are an old-fashioned, but effective, method of\n occluding a whole limb. • Clean the skin, and apply an emollient and/or a topical\n corticosteroid ointment, if required. • If the paste bandage is simply wrapped around the limb in a\n continuous spiral, as it dries, it may tighten and restrict blood\n supply. • Either cut up the bandage and wrap around the leg in single\n overlapping strips or use the pleating method of bandaging (see\n Fig. 34.1).",
