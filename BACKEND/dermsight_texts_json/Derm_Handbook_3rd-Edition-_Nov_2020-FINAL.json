    "text": "Preface to the 3rd edition\n\n11 years have passed since this Handbook first appeared. It has proved immensely popular\nand it has been further updated. We hope that it will continue to be a valuable source book\nfor those interested in learning about this exciting specialty. The Handbook was designed to\nbe an overview, both succinct and reader-friendly which continues to be our aim.\n\nOnce again, many thanks to the BAD for its essential and continuing support.\n\nJulian Verbov\n\nProfessor of Dermatology Liverpool 2020\n\n Foreword to Third edition\n\nPast BAD President Dr Mark Goodfield wrote in the first edition:\n‘There is a real need for appropriate information about dermatological diseases to meet the\neducational needs of doctors at all levels.’\n\nThis holds true even more today than in 2009 with the exponential use of social media as an\ninformation sourced by patients and clinicians alike. Since its first publication, this book has\nbeen the go to resource for accurate knowledge in common and urgent dermatological\nproblems. Its essential role in supporting their workplace learning is highlighted by the 8,843\ndownloads and 50,000 requests for hard copies from individual students and medical\nschools throughout the UK. Starting with scientific and epidemiological facts, moving\nthrough clinical features and management, medical students are given a structure that\nenables them to organise learning effectively. The content remains focused on learning at\nthe undergraduate stage of the medical education spectrum: a vital foundation for\npostgraduate training in dermatology.\n\nThe UK population has become increasingly diverse over the last few decades, it is therefore\nnecessary to update the handbook to highlight tips for assessment, variation in presentation\nin common and important skin conditions (e.g. common pigmentary disorders) that reflect\nthe spectrum of cutaneous diversity junior clinicians will encounter in their practice. This, in\ncombination, with other BAD resources under current development will ensure that medical\nstudents continue to learn from the highest quality education in dermatology to the benefit\nof our patients.\n\nDr Tanya Bleiker\nPresident of the British Association of Dermatologists\n\nProf Mini Singh\nUndergraduate Work Stream Chair, British Association of Dermatologists",

    "text": "What is dermatology?\n\n • Dermatology is the study of both normal and abnormal skin and associated\n\n structures such as hair, nails, and oral and genital mucous membranes.\n\nWhy is dermatology important?\n\n • Skin diseases are very common, affecting up to a third of the population at any one\n\n time.\n\n • Skin diseases have serious impacts on life. They can cause physical damage,\n\n embarrassment, and social and occupational restrictions. Chronic skin diseases may\n\n cause financial constraints with repeated sick leave. Some skin conditions can be\n\n life-threatening.\n\n • In 2006-07, the total NHS health expenditure for skin diseases was estimated to be\n\n around ₤97 million (approximately 2% of the total NHS health expenditure).\n\nWhat is this handbook about?\n\n • The British Association of Dermatologists outlined the essential and important\n\n learning outcomes that should be achieved by all medical undergraduates for the\n\n competent assessment of patients presenting with skin disorders (available on:\n\n https://www.bad.org.uk/shared/get-file.ashx?itemtype=document&id=4168)\n\n • This handbook addresses these learning outcomes and aims to equip you with the\n\n knowledge and skills to practise competently and safely as a junior doctor.",

It is suitable for localised and less severe skin conditions. They\n\n consist of active constituents which are transported into the skin by a base (also\n\n known as a ‘vehicle’). Examples of active ingredients are steroids, tar,\n\n immunomodulators, retinoids, and antibiotics. The common forms of base are lotion\n\n (liquid), cream (oil in water), gel (organic polymers in liquid, transparent), ointment\n\n (oil with little or no water) and paste (powder in ointment).\n • Systemic therapy is used for extensive and more serious skin conditions, if the\n\n treatment is ineffective topically or if there is systemic involvement.
