    "text": "Foreword to the\n second edition\n\nIf you are faced with a challenging skin problem, then pull this brilliant\nand magical book from your bag, or search it with your electronic device:\nthe answer will be there. It is packed with top tips, information gems and\nclinical pearls. Whether you are a student needing a logical and clear way\nto understand dermatology, if you are in primary care faced with a diagnosis that requires a quick refresh of your memory, or a hospital doctor\nor dermatology trainee dealing with emergencies and complex cases,\nthis book will become your friend and companion.\n This new edition introduces fresh new writing on eczema and tumours,\na new chapter on genetic skin diseases and expansion of the tropical\ndiseases section. Dinny Wallis has updated the rheumatology disorders\nand vasculitis. Rubeta Matin has joined the team from Oxford bringing\nexpertise in immunosuppression. The whole book is right up to date so\nexperienced consultant dermatologists will find it a useful quick reference for managing complex diseases. The text flows and draws in the\nreader who will quickly be absorbed, oblivious to passing time.\n The question and answer format, the text boxes and the clarity of\nthe writing make the second edition of Sue Burge’s Oxford Handbook of\nMedical Dermatology the go-to small dermatology textbook. The British\nSociety of Medical Dermatology gives this as a prize to the best UK trainees at their meeting each year. This is the book to get if you truly wish to\nunderstand dermatology.\n\n Nick Levell\n President: British Association of Dermatologists (2016–18);\n Director of Dermatology, Consultant Dermatologist,\n Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital;\n Specialty National Lead (Dermatology), National Institute\n of Health Research, UK",

    "text": "Foreword to the\n first edition\n\nDr Susan Burge and I ﬁrst (really) met as senior registrars to the\nDepartment of Dermatology in Oxford in 1981. It soon became apparent to me that Susan’s most commonly asked question was ‘why?’, always\nspoken in a most expressive Northern Irish accent. Usually there was no\neasy answer which of course indicated why she had asked the question\nin the ﬁ rst place. If an answer was preferred it had to make sense, be\nlogical and simple. Any ﬂannel would meet with short shrift! This story\nreﬂ ects the (senior) author’s enquiring mind and need for knowledge to\nbe imparted in a sound, simple and logical way. It therefore comes as no\nsurprise that the format of the new textbook is prompted by questions:\nWhat should I look for? What should I do?\n Dermatology is arguably the most clinical of all medical specialties\nbecause it relies less on investigation and more on good old fashioned\nobservation and interpretation of symptoms and signs for diagnosis.\nDermatology practice is sometimes criticized for being simply a ‘spot\ndiagnosis’ and for using outdated Latin terminology. The diagnosis and\nmanagement of skin disease, however, demands a logical ordering and\nstructuring of clinical information in such a way that makes it a most stimulating intellectual exercise which has few equals among other medical\nspecialties.\n In this new book Susan and Dinny, who is currently in specialist training\nin rheumatology, bring a refreshingly new approach to learning dermatology. The combination of old and young authors (forgive me Susan!)\nbrings a nice balance of wisdom and practicality—exactly what the junior\ndoctor requires.\n\n Professor Peter Mortimer\n Professor of Dermatological Medicine to the University of London,\n Consultant Skin Physician to St George’s Hospital, London,\n and the Royal Marsden Hospital,\n London",

    "text": "Preface\n\nThe second edition of this Handbook still provides a practical introduction to dermatology, with an emphasis on the medical aspects of the specialty. Skin problems are hugely variable (>2500 diagnoses), but we hope\nthis little book will help you to make sense of what you find and will provide you with a framework for analysing clinical signs, so that you develop\nyour diagnostic expertise. Dermatology trainees should find the book\nparticularly useful, as may hospital doctors in other medical specialties\nfaced with assessing skin problems, but it also includes much that will be\nof value to those working in the community and to medical students.\n The content has been updated, and we have tried to make it even\nmore comprehensive. We include a new chapter on dermatogenetics\nand have added to other sections, particularly those on skin in infancy\nand childhood, cutaneous reactions to drugs, skin tumours, and skin and\nrheumatology.\n We discuss common and important skin problems, such as skin failure\nand emergency dermatology, eczema, psoriasis, blisters, vasculitis, and\npustular rashes, but also include some fascinating rarities that we hope\nmay inspire you to read more. Each topic includes answers to the clinical questions ‘What should I ask?’, ‘What should I look for?’, and ‘What\nshould I do?’. Management guidelines have been incorporated, where\npossible.\n The expanded tumour chapter will help you to recognize and manage\nskin tumours, including those in immunosuppressed individuals, as well\nas to advise on photoprotection, but the Handbook does not include\ninformation on surgical techniques in dermatology.\n Chapters on skin problems in the medical specialties should be of particular interest to physicians working in those disciplines. We introduce\nskin conditions that you may encounter when working in specialties such\nas rheumatology, haematology, nephrology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology. The section on medical management introduces topical\ntreatments, occlusion, and wet dressings, as well as discussing the systemic drugs commonly used in dermatology.\n Illustrations complement the text, but the emphasis is on enabling you\nto make sense of the findings using your clinical skills, rather than matching findings to pictures.\n We hope that you will find this book useful when you are asked to see\nsomeone with a puzzling skin problem and that there will be a place for it\nin your pocket, in the outpatient clinic, or on the ward.\n Please send back your comments or criticisms, so that we can improve\nthe book in future editions. You can send your comments to us via the\nOUP website M http://www.oup.co.uk.",

    "text": "Introduction\nThe skin is the largest organ in the body and the heaviest—an adult’s\nskin weighs 4–5kg. Skin is not an inert barrier but plays an active part\nin defending against insults (microbial, physical, and chemical) from the\nexternal environment.\n In this chapter, we aim to give you an insight into what your skin is\ndoing for you, in the hope that this will encourage you to care for the\nskin of your patients (and your own skin) with the respect it deserves. An\nunderstanding of cutaneous physiology will also help you to analyse what\nhas gone wrong or what might happen in patients with skin problems,\nincluding skin failure.\n We discuss the structure of the skin and consider how this finely tuned\norgan functions as a barrier (‘keeping the inside in and the outside out’)\nand reduces water loss, is part of the immune system, is a metabolic\norgan synthesizing vitamin D and cytokines, regulates body temperature, and senses noxious stimuli (skin on the tips of your fingers is particularly sensitive; see Box 1.1).\n Most of us will, at some stage, worry about the appearance of our\nskin, hair, and/or nails. ‘Looking good’ gives us confidence, and we may\ntry to enhance the appearance (or smell) of our skin if we want to display\nourselves to make a positive impression or attract a sexual partner. It is\nno surprise that fortunes are spent on lotions, potions, and procedures\ndesigned to conceal blemishes (actual or imagined) and to restore the\nappearance of youth. The psychological aspects of skin problems are discussed in more detail in E Chapter 28, pp. 570–1.\n\n Box 1.1 Dermatoglyphics (fingerprints)\n • Fingertips, palms, soles, and toes are covered with a pattern of\n epidermal ridges called dermatoglyphics.\n • The three basic patterns (loops, arches, and whorls) are unique to\n each individual.\n • Characteristic dermatoglyphic patterns accompany many\n chromosomal abnormalities.\n • The ridges amplify vibrations when your finger brushes across a\n rough surface.\n • The ridges enhance grip.\n • Autosomal dominant adermatoglyphia (SMARCAD1 mutation)—\n absence of epidermal ridges, also known as ‘immigration delay\n disease’. Also absent in some rare genodermatoses and in cases of\n palmoplantar dysaesthesias secondary to chemotherapy drugs.",

    "text": "Epidermis\nThe epidermis originates from embryonic neuroectodermal cells. The\nepidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium composed of layers of\nkeratinocytes that differentiate as they move towards the skin surface\n(see Box 1.2). The epidermis is attached to an underlying collagenous\ndermis, which contains the blood vessels that nourish the epidermis.\nDownward projections of epidermal rete pegs interlock with upward\nprojecting dermal papillae, stabilizing the structure and making it difficult\nto shear the epidermis from the dermis (see Fig. 1.1).\nStructure of the epidermis\n(See Fig. 1.2.)\n• A single layer of columnar keratinocytes in the deepest layer of the\n epidermis (basal layer) is attached to a basement membrane that is\n an interface between the epidermis and the underlying dermis. The\n basal cells are anchored to the basement membrane by adhesion\n junctions called hemidesmosomes (see E p. 262).\n• Regeneration of the epidermis (and hair follicles; see E p. 10)\n depends on populations of epidermal stem cells.\n• The middle layers of the epidermis (spinous or prickle cell layers)\n have a spiky appearance under a light microscope, because of the\n intercellular junctions (desmosomes) that are the main adhesive force\n between adjacent keratinocytes (see E p. 262).\n• The outermost horny layer or stratum corneum is composed of\n layers of flattened keratinocytes (corneocytes) locked together by\n modified desmosomes (corneodesmosomes) in a lipid matrix.\n• All keratinocytes contain keratin intermediate filaments, but\n the structure of the keratins changes as the cells differentiate\n (see Box 1.2).\n• Melanocytes are dendritic cells that are interspersed amongst the\n basal keratinocytes (approximate ratio 1:6) (see E pp. 12–3).\n• Epidermal Langerhans cells (dendritic antigen-presenting cells) are\n found throughout the epidermis (see E p. 14).\n• Migratory leucocytes are present in small numbers in the epidermis.\nProliferation and shedding\n• The thickness of normal epidermis (0.05–0.1mm) is regulated by the\n balance between proliferation of basal keratinocytes and shedding of\n cells at the surface (desquamation).\n• It takes 740 days for a keratinocyte to move upwards from the basal\n layer to the horny layer where, after proteolytic breakdown of\n adhesion junctions, cells flake off (desquamate) (see Box 1.2).\n• The activity of epidermal proteases and their inhibitors regulate\n cornification and desquamation.",

In acute\n eczema, hyaluronan secreted by keratinocytes into the intercellular\n space takes up water and may dilute noxious chemicals\n (see E pp. 214–16).\n • Keratinocytes change (differentiate), as they move from the basal\n layer towards the skin surface:\n • The types of keratins in the cells and the composition of the\n desmosomes change.\n • A protein called filaggrin aggregates and cross-links the keratin\n filaments, giving the keratinocytes internal strength. Loss-offunction mutations in filaggrin are associated with ichthyosis\n vulgaris, atopic eczema, and food allergies in older children.\n • The cell envelope is strengthened by Ca2+-dependent crosslinking of proteins, such as involucrin and loricrin, and is catalysed\n by transglutaminase-1 (TGM1). Mutations in TGM1 cause\n ichthyosis (abnormalities in the cell envelope and desquamation).\n • Lipid is synthesized by keratinocytes and accumulates in the\n intercellular space.\n • By the time the keratinocytes reach the outermost horny layer,\n they have lost their nuclei and subcellular organelles and are\n densely packed with keratin filaments.\n • The outermost horny layer is composed of 720 layers of flattened\n horny cells (corneocytes) with tough insoluble cell membranes\n (cornified envelopes) locked together by corneodesmosomes and\n a thick intercellular layer of lipids (like mortar).

Darkly pigmented skin\n seems to provide a better epidermal barrier than lightly pigmented\n skin—the stratum corneum is less permeable and more cohesive.\n • Permeability of the skin depends primarily on the balance between\n intercellular cohesion and desquamation in the stratum corneum.\n Serine proteases, such as kallikreins, degrade corneodesmosomes,\n so cells can desquamate. Inhibitors, such as lymphoepithelial Kazaltype 5 serine protease inhibitor (LEKTI), control protease activity.\n In Netherton syndrome, mutations in the SPINK5 gene encoding\n LEKTI lead to defective LEKTI expression, unregulated proteolytic\n activity, increased desquamation, and highly permeable skin\n (see E Box 31.11, p. 603).",

Short, fine, soft, non-pigmented vellus\n hair covers most of the body (you can just feel vellus hair on your\n forehead), and coarse, pigmented terminal hair grows at sites such\n as the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, limbs, genitalia, and axillae.\n Androgens influence the hair type—some vellus hair changes\n to terminal hair in hirsutism (see E p. 474).\n• The cylindrical follicular root sheath moulds the shape of the\n hair shaft.\n• A bulge region in the mid portion of the root sheath contains\n epithelial hair follicle stem cells from which the follicle arises (see\n Fig. 1.3). These stem cells regulate the hair cycle (see Box 1.3).\n Damage to stem cells may contribute to irreversible hair loss\n (scarring alopecia) in inflammatory conditions such as cutaneous\n lupus erythematosus.\n• The hair shaft arises from dividing cells in the bulb at the bottom\n of the follicle.

    "text": "Melanocytes and colour\nMelanin, synthesized by melanocytes, provides some defence against\nultraviolet radiation (UVR) as well as giving colour to skin and hair. Skin\ncolour and ease of tanning are important determinants of the risk of skin\ncancer (see E pp. 320–1 and p. 346, and Chapters 16 and 17).\n• Melanocytes are dendritic cells that migrate from the neural\n crest to the epidermis and hair follicles in the third month of fetal\n development.\n• Melanocytes are interspersed amongst the basal keratinocytes in the\n epidermis. Melanocyte stem cells are found in the bulge region of hair\n follicles from where they migrate to the hair bulb (see Fig. 1.3).\n• Melanocytes synthesize both brown/black eumelanin and red/yellow\n phaeomelanin from tyrosine.\n• Melanin is passed in packages (melanosomes) along dendritic\n processes into keratinocytes (see Fig. 1.2) where melanosomes\n sit in a cap or ‘parasol’ over the upper sun-exposed side of the\n keratinocyte nucleus. Each melanocyte links to a number of\n keratinocytes, forming an epidermal melanin unit. Melanin provides\n UV protection by absorbing visible light and UVR (see E pp. 320–1).\n• UVR induces tanning by stimulating oxidation of pre-existing melanin,\n by triggering the synthesis of new melanin, and by changing the\n distribution of melanosomes (see E pp. 320–1).\n• Melanin is the main determinant of the colour of skin and hair (see\n Box 1.4). The colour depends on the number, size, and distribution\n of melanosomes within keratinocytes and the type of melanin,\n rather than the number of melanocytes. Darkly pigmented skin has\n similar numbers of melanocytes to lightly pigmented skin, but more\n and slightly differently packaged melanin (melanosomes) within\n keratinocytes.\n• Skin colour is not uniform (see Box 1.5).\n• Darkly pigmented skin has better epidermal barrier function than\n lightly pigmented skin (see Box 1.2).\n• Genetic variation in the amino acid sequence of the melanocortin 1\n receptor (MC1R) is a major determinant of skin and hair colour. Some\n variants, e.g. redheads, do not tan in response to sun.

    "text": "Skin immune system\nThe skin immune system (both innate and adaptive) provides vital\ndefence against external cutaneous pathogens or physical injury.\nKeratinocytes\nKeratinocytes respond to cutaneous injury or infection by releasing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as β-defensins and cathelicidins, that\nhave broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and\nviruses. AMPs may also reduce the likelihood of microbes entering the\nskin through follicular openings. AMPs are part of the innate immune\nsystem (see Box 1.6). Keratinocytes can also produce a wide range of\ncytokines: pro- or anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and immunosuppressive. Alarmin cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-33, can be\nreleased in response to cell damage. Cathelicidins induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhance cell migration and promote wound healing. Vitamin D3 seems to be involved in the regulation\nof cathelicidin expression in the epidermis. Keratinocytes are also able to\npresent antigens to T-cells.\nDendritic cells\nDendritic antigen-presenting cells, such as epidermal Langerhans cells\nand dermal dendritic cells, express major histocompatibility complex\n(MHC) class II antigens and CD1 on their surface and ‘police’ the skin.\nThey are part of the 1st line of defence if the skin is breached. The cells\ntrap, ingest, process, and present antigens, in association with MHC\n(peptide antigens) or CD1 (lipid antigens), to the receptors of T-cells.\nLymphatics\nLangerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells that have trapped antigens\nmigrate via afferent lymphatics to draining lymph nodes where the processed antigen is presented to naïve T-cells that have the receptor that\nwill bind that antigen. This triggers the generation of activated and memory T-cells imprinted with specific combinations of adhesion molecules\nand chemokine receptors that target their migration to the skin.\nT-cells\nMemory T-cells can be resident in the skin or can patrol the body for\nforeign antigens, recirculating through lymph nodes, lymphatics, blood\nvessels, and skin. Endothelial adhesion molecules aid trafficking by tethering flowing T-cells, so they can migrate through endothelial junctions.\nChemokine gradients direct migration in the skin.\n The receptor of each memory T-lymphocyte will bind to a specific\npeptide antigen presented on the surface of target cells in association\nwith MHC class I (for CD8+ T-cells) or class II (for CD4+ T-cells). Some\nT-cells can recognize lipid antigens presented by the CD1 family of molecules. The antigen–MHC complex interacts with the T-cell receptor,\nwhich, along with co-stimulatory molecules, triggers the release of\ncytokines that attract more lymphocytes into the skin to augment the\ninflammatory response",

    "text": "Box 1.6 What is the innate immune system?\n\n The innate immune system is the first line of defence against environmental insults. The response is rapid and efficient but is less specific\n than adaptive immunity and does not improve with repeated exposure.\n Receptors (transmembrane and intracellular), such as Toll-like\n receptors, recognize highly conserved molecular patterns that are\n common to many classes of pathogen, e.g. components of the wall of\n microbes.\n Activated receptors stimulate the production of cytokines,\n chemokines, and AMPs. Immune cells, such as innate lymphoid cells\n (e.g. natural killer cells), and neutrophils are activated and recruited\n to the site of injury or infection. This innate response kills pathogens,\n promotes angiogenesis, and initiates repair after injury.\n The major components of the skin innate immune system are:\n • Intact physical barrier: stratum corneum and intercellular junctions.\n • Antigen-presenting cells, keratinocytes, mast cells, innate lymphoid\n cells and neutrophils.\n • AMPs, cytokines, and chemokines.\n\nFurther reading\nSalimi M and Ogg G.

    "text": "The dermatological history: 1\n\nSetting the scene\nIntroduce yourself; make the patient comfortable; ensure privacy (difficult on a ward), and allow sufficient time to establish rapport and for\nthe patient to explain what has happened. Remember that skin problems\ncan be embarrassing. Your history will be guided by the nature of the\nproblem—a rash, a leg ulcer, or a skin tumour—but ‘Please tell me about\nyour skin problem’ is a good opening question.\nFinding out what the patient means\nClarify what the patient means by words such as blemish, wheal, hive,\nscar, or blister. Patients, as well as many doctors, find it difficult to\ndescribe rashes. You may think that you know what is meant, but make\nsure you use these words to describe the same thing as the patient. For\nexample, some people call any raised lesion a ‘blister’ but do not mean\na bump filled with clear fluid, and people may use the word ‘scar’ to\ndescribe post-inflammatory pigmentation without any dermal damage.\nEven ‘sunburn’ means different things to different people. Some people\nuse this term to describe getting a suntan.\n Sometimes the rash will have changed or even disappeared, and you\nwill have nothing but the patient’s description to help you make a diagnosis, so the description should be as accurate as possible (see Box 2.1).\nThe patient may bring photographs to clinic.\nGetting on the same wavelength\nClarify the patient’s preconceptions about the cause of the problem, as\nwell as their expectations of the consultation and your role. It is helpful\nto know more about the patient’s perception of the current severity of\nthe condition, particularly in those with fluctuating inflammatory rashes.\nThis may differ markedly from your own assessment (see Box 2.2). You\nneed to understand what matters to the patient, so ask ‘What is most\nimportant to you?’. This will help you and the patient to set goals when\nplanning investigation and treatment (see E p. 32).\nSymptoms, causation, and impact\n‘How does your rash/skin condition bother you?’ is another good open\nquestion to start off the discussion (see Box 2.3).\n Document the relationship of the condition to work, hobbies, and\ndrugs, including herbal medicines and health foods. Might the rash be\nrelated to the menstrual cycle (a catamenial dermatosis)?\n Skin conditions can be both disfiguring and embarrassing, and treatments can be messy, unpleasant, and time-consuming, so find out how\nthe skin condition is affecting the life of the patient, as well as that of the\nfamily and/or carers.\n More information about questions to ask in specific circumstances is\ngiven later in this chapter (also see E DLQI under Quality of life, p. 32).",

Is it cyclical?\n• If transient—how long do individual lesions last, and, when they\n fade, what does the skin look like? Are there any changes in skin\n colour or any marking (scarring)?\n• Are hair, nails, or mucosal surfaces affected?\n\nBox 2.2 Grading the skin condition: the patient’s\nperception\nIt helps to have some insight into the patient’s perception of the severity of\nhis/her skin condition as it is now. Ask the patient to grade the condition:\n ‘You have explained that your rash/skin condition can vary a bit.\nI would like to get a feel for how bad it is for you today by asking you to\ngrade your skin condition. Let us say that a grade of 10 means it is the\nworst it has ever been for you and zero means that you have no skin\nproblem. What grade would you give your skin today?’\n\nBox 2.3 Questions to ask when exploring symptoms and\nimpact of a skin condition\n• What does the rash feel like? Is the skin tender, itchy, or painful?\n• What brings on the itch/pain? What does the patient do about it?\n• Itch—try to quantify the impact. Does it affect sleep or concentration?\n• Is anyone else itchy? Ask about family and all close contacts,\n e.g. sexual partner (could it be scabies?).\n• Pain: what is the character of the pain? Sharp, dull, throbbing,\n paraesthesiae, continuous, or intermittent?\n• Does the skin ooze clear fluid, pus, or blood?\n• Is the skin fragile? Does it bruise easily, or does the skin blister?\n• Has the patient noticed a smell from the skin (ulcer)? Patients\n may welcome a chance to discuss this awkward and embarrassing\n symptom if you introduce the subject in a sensitive manner.\n• What makes the rash better or worse? Is there any relationship\n to recent travel, work, or hobbies? Does the problem improve\n or worsen at the weekends or in holidays? Does sunlight make a\n difference?

    "text": "History in patients with allergy\n\nType I hypersensitivity\nUrticaria (hives, wheals, welts) is an immediate type I hypersensitivity\nreaction that may occur on its own or in association with angio-oedema\nand/or anaphylaxis. Urticaria is commoner in atopics.\n Acute urticaria may be triggered by drugs, e.g. penicillin, or foods, e.g.\npeanuts, fish. The patient can often identify the allergen. In contrast, it\nis difficult to pinpoint the trigger in most patients with chronic urticaria.\nPhysical urticarias can be triggered by firm pressure (dermographism),\nheat, cold, sun, or exercise.\n The wheals of urticaria are 2° to dermal oedema. They are raised,\nsmooth, erythematous, and usually itchy. Angio-oedema implies oedema\nof the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissues, as well as mucosal and\nsubmucosal oedema. Patients describe the sudden onset of large tender swellings involving the skin, mucosae, and submucosal tissues (see\nE Chapter 5, pp. 104–5, and Chapter 11, p. 228 and pp. 230–1).\n The history should be directed at finding out exactly what happened to\nconfirm the diagnosis of urticaria and/or angio-oedema, as the rash may\nnot be present when you see the patient (see Boxes 2.4 and 2.5). Does\nthe patient have one or both problems? • Rarely, angio-oedema can be\ncaused by a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (inherited or acquired),\nbut these patients do not have urticaria (see E p. 104).\n Prick testing may be helpful to investigate the cause in some cases of\nacute urticaria, particularly if there is a history suggesting food allergy,\nbut such testing is unlikely to be helpful in chronic urticaria.\nIrritant contact dermatitis or type IV hypersensitivity\nDermatitis (eczema) caused by an external agent is known as contact\ndermatitis. Contact dermatitis may be irritant or, less often, allergic.\n Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by chronic exposure to irritants\n(wet work, detergents, chemicals) and is commonest in individuals with\natopic eczema who already have an inadequate skin barrier.\n Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IV hypersensitivity. The patient has\nto be sensitized by prior exposure to the allergen, sometimes for months\nor years, before the onset of allergy. The eczematous response is maximal 5–7 days after exposure to the allergen. Allergic contact dermatitis\nis less common in children than in adults. Irritant contact dermatitis is\ncommoner than allergy.\n If you suspect an allergic contact dermatitis, direct your history\ntowards elucidating the cause (see Box 2.6) by exploring the relationship\nof the rash to activities (work, hobbies). Patch testing is the investigation\nof choice (see E Chapter 10, pp. 214–16).\n A 2° allergic contact dermatitis may complicate the picture in an individual with long-standing dermatitis of another type, particularly when\nmany different medicaments or over-the-counter preparations have\nbeen used over a prolonged period. Consider this possibility in individuals with chronic problems such as leg ulcers, pruritus ani, hand dermatitis facial dermatitis or otitis externa",

Androgenetic alopecia is patterned in men (male-pattern baldness), with loss being most marked on the vertex of the scalp and/or the\ntemples. Women with androgenetic alopecia describe diffuse thinning.\n The commonest cause of sudden diffuse shedding is telogen effluvium\n(see Box 2.7)—a great diagnosis to make, because you can reassure your\npatient that he/she will not lose all their hair and that the hair will grow\nback. Drugs may also cause reversible hair loss (see Box 2.8).\nWhat should I ask the patient?\n• When did the problem start? Has this happened before?\n• Establish if hair was shed suddenly or gradually.\n• Is the loss diffuse or in patches?\n• Is the loss complete, leaving bald patches, or partial?\n• Is hair being lost at other sites, e.g. eyebrows, eyelashes, axillae?\n Alopecia areata can be widespread—alopecia totalis (all scalp hair) or\n universalis (all body hair).\n• Are teeth or nails abnormal (indication of an ectodermal problem)?\n• Is the patient still shedding excess hair? Remember it is normal to\n shed 100–150 hairs a day, and this may appear to be a lot to an\n anxious patient, particularly if the hair is long.\n• Is the loss associated with other symptoms such as itching or scaling?\n Eczema and psoriasis are not usually associated with hair loss, but\n fungal infections certainly are. Some fungal infections cause no\n inflammation and minimal scale.\n• How does the patient care for the hair—hot combs, perms, hair\n straighteners, colouring?\n• Is the hair ever tied back tightly and for how long each day?\n• Does the patient pull or pluck the hair?\n• Did the patient start any new medications prior to the hair loss?\n (See Box 2.8.)\n• Any exposure to radiation?\n• Is there a family history of hair loss?\n• Do close contacts have similar problems?\n• Was there an event 8–12 weeks prior to the onset of loss,\n e.g. serious illness that might have triggered telogen effluvium?\n (See Box 2.7.)\n• Has the patient just had a baby?

    "text": "History in photosensitivity\nPhotosensitivity is defined as an abnormal cutaneous response involving the interaction between photosensitizing substances and sunlight or\nfiltered or artificial light. People who are photosensitive are easily sunburnt. The skin is uncomfortable or develops a rash when exposed to\nsunlight or filtered or artificial light. You may suspect photosensitivity\nfrom the history or if you find a rash predominantly on sun-exposed surfaces (see E Box 4.6, p. 73). Photosensitivity is most often an acquired\nproblem (see Boxes 2.9 and 2.10).\n Sometimes conditions, such as atopic eczema or psoriasis, are made\nworse by sunlight (photoaggravated).\nWhat should I ask?\nSpecific questions will help you to pinpoint the type and cause of the\nphotosensitivity.\n• At what age did the problem start?\n• Were any drugs or topical agents started prior to the onset of the\n problem? Most cases will present within 6 weeks of starting the\n drug, but drugs started in late autumn may not cause a rash until the\n following spring or summer.\n• What are the symptoms—itch, pain, burning?\n• Is there a rash? What is the distribution, and what does it look like—\n redness, swelling, blisters, pigmentation?\n• How quickly does the problem occur after exposure to sunlight?\n• How long does the problem persist—minutes, hours, or days?\n• Does the rash leave any pigmentation when it fades?\n• What time of year does the problem present—is there any seasonal\n variation? Symptoms usually commence in the spring.\n• What sort of exposure is required to trigger the problem?\n • How much exposure is required to cause the rash?\n • Does sunlight in the United Kingdom (UK) produce the eruption,\n or does it only happen when the patient is abroad?\n • Does it happen if the light comes through glass, e.g. when sitting\n next to a window or when driving? Ultraviolet B (UVB), unlike\n ultraviolet A (UVA) or visible light, cannot penetrate glass\n (see E p. 320).\n • Does lying on a sunbed (UVA) trigger the problem?\n• Is there any evidence of ‘hardening’, i.e. does the skin become\n tolerant after repeated exposures to sunlight or a sunbed?\n Paradoxically, some problems improve, as summer progresses, and\n the rash may spare chronically exposed skin on the face.\n• Are antihistamines, sunscreen creams, or clothing protective?\n• What impact does the problem have on the quality of life?\n• Is there a history of skin cancer, and did skin cancers occur at an\n earlier age than one would expect, given the skin type and history of\n sun exposure? Some photosensitive patients are more prone to skin\n cancers (see E pp. 336–7).\n• What hobbies or occupation does the patient have?",

    "text": "Why the skin condition has not\nresponded to treatment\nPatients often say that the treatment ‘has not worked’. It is important to\nexplore exactly what is meant by this statement. It is not pleasant using\nmessy ointments, and some people, particularly older people and those\nliving alone, may find it difficult to apply the treatment. It is hardly surprising if patients do not adhere to treatment plans.\nWhat should I ask the patient?\n• What does the patient mean by the phrase ‘has not worked’—are\n the patient’s expectations realistic? Most skin conditions can be\n controlled, but cure is the exception, rather than the rule.\n• Have you established what matters to the patient by asking ‘What is\n most important to you?’. The answer will help you and the patient to\n agree treatment goals (see Box 2.11).\n• Has the patient given the treatment enough time to ‘work’? It may\n take 3 or 4 months before some treatments have a maximal effect.\n• If the patient has stopped the treatment, what was the reason?\n Were there any problems applying the treatment or reactions to\n the treatment? Was the patient under the impression that it was a\n ‘course’ of treatment that would be stopped, rather than an ongoing\n treatment?\n• Did the patient collect the prescribed medicaments or more\n medicaments from the general practitioner (GP) after the initial\n prescription?\n• What was prescribed? It is not sufficient to know the name. You\n need more information before agreeing with the patient that ‘it does\n not work’ (see Box 2.12). It will help if the patient can show you the\n preparations being used—they may not be what you think were\n prescribed!\n• When, where, and how is the preparation applied? Ask open\n questions to find out exactly what the patient is doing: ‘Tell me more\n about how you use your treatment’.\n• How much is being applied, and how often? Underuse is common.\n • Steroid phobia is a common cause of treatment failure. How long\n does the 30g or 100g tube of steroid ointment last? Some parents\n may be very reluctant to apply topical steroids to their child’s\n eczematous skin (see E pp. 608–9).\n • Emollients should be used liberally and frequently. Was the patient\n given a 500g tub?\n• It can be particularly confusing for the patient if several topical\n preparations were prescribed. Are they to be used at the same time\n or sequentially; all over the skin or just on localized areas?\n• Has anyone shown the patient how to use the treatment? There is\n a knack to applying topical medicaments. Ideally, all patients with\n chronic skin problems would see a dermatology nurse. The nurse can\n answer questions, explain (again) what the treatment is likely to do,\n d h h i ( ) h h If d",

    "text": "Box 2.11 Shared decision-making\n Decisions about care should be patient-centred and collaborative.\n Your role, as a clinician, is to help the patient to understand the options\n and to reach a decision after considering his values, beliefs, and goals.\n Patient-centred care, utilizing shared decision-making, is associated\n with improved patient satisfaction, improved adherence to medication, and better outcomes.\n Shared decision-making involves three steps:\n 1. Explaining/discussing the need to consider alternatives (team talk).\n 2. Describing the alternatives in more detail (option talk). At this\n stage, it may be helpful to introduce an option grid: a one-page\n evidence-based summary of options and frequently asked\n questions (see Option Grids website, available at M www.\n optiongrid.org).\n 3. Helping the patient to explore their personal preferences and\n to reach a decision (decision talk). But give the patient time to\n consider all the information—it may be entirely reasonable to\n defer reaching a decision until another day.\n\n Box 2.12 Questions to ask when exploring what\n was prescribed\n • Is the product a cream, an ointment, or a lotion?\n • Ointments have fewer preservatives and are less likely to irritate\n the skin than creams. They are also more effective than creams in\n dry, scaly conditions. But some people stop treatment, because\n they dislike the feel of the greasy film left on the surface of the skin\n or the mess left on clothes. They may also have the erroneous\n perception that the ointment does not ‘get into the skin’. The\n answer may be to use an ointment in the evenings and a cream in\n the daytime.\n • Some people find the skin is itchier under an occlusive ointment\n than under a cream.\n • Preservatives in creams can sting inflamed skin or cause transient\n erythema. People who misinterpret these problems as a sign of\n ‘allergy’ will stop the treatment.\n • Was the patient prescribed enough of the preparation? Hopefully, a\n 500g tub of moisturizer (emollient), rather than a small tube? Most\n medicaments come in 30g or 100g tubes.\n\nFurther reading\nElwyn G et al.

    "text": "Assessing the impact of skin conditions\n\nImpact of skin diseases\nOur appearance affects the way we feel about ourselves and how well\nwe function. The skin is always on show, particularly on the face and\nhands. If we think that we ‘look good’, we are more likely to ‘feel good’\nand have confidence.\n The psychosocial and physical impact of highly visible inflammatory skin\ndiseases, such as psoriasis, acne, or atopic eczema, may be profound.\nSkin diseases disrupt school, work, and social life. Low self-esteem, common in teenagers with acne, may affect personal relationships, as well as\nprospects of employment. Inherited skin diseases, such as epidermolysis\nbullosa (EB), may be even more devastating. Patients, their families, and\nfriends may find it difficult to cope.\n Patients with chronic scaly skin conditions may also have a deepseated, and probably quite irrational, fear of being contagious. ‘I feel\nlike a leper’. This may be reinforced by the reaction of family and/or\nfriends who have an equally deep-seated fear of ‘catching something’.\nThe patient withdraws from physical and social contact.\n Skin conditions in patients with other medical problems may be the\n‘last straw’, e.g. the intractable itching in chronic liver or renal failure\nwhich can be more difficult to control than pain; photosensitivity in diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which may have a\nmajor impact on normal daily activities; hair loss or pigmentary changes\nwhich may be disabling; and highly visible adverse effects of drugs (see\nE pp. 372–91) or the result of conditions such as chronic graft-versushost disease (GVHD) (see E pp. 534–6).\nQuality of life\nConsider measuring quality of life objectively, using a validated questionnaire such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (M www.\ncardiff.ac.uk/dermatology/quality-of-life/dermatology-quality-of-lifeindex-dlqi/) (see Boxes 2.13 and 2.14). This tool will give you insight into\npatients’ perceptions of the impact of their skin conditions on their lives\nand also help you to assess the effectiveness of interventions such as education, counselling, and, of course, treatment. The reaction of patients\nis not predictable and sometimes may seem out of proportion to the\nseverity of the skin disease. The DLQI provides insight into that reaction.\n The DLQI is self-explanatory and is designed for patients over the age\nof 16 years. It can be handed to the patient before the consultation and\ntakes 1 or 2min to complete. A similar questionnaire has been validated\nfor use in children. Skindex is another dermatology-specific healthrelated quality of life instrument that can be self-administered. Tools\nhave also been developed for specific conditions, e.g. hand eczema.\nItch severity scale\nItch is the commonest symptom in dermatology, and severe itch may\nbe extremely debilitating. A questionnaire (completed by the patient)\nquantifies how much of the day itch is a problem the quality of itch",

    "text": "Skin and the psyche\n\nImpact of skin disease on mood\nPeople with skin disease may feel shame or embarrassment and have\npoor self-image or low self-esteem. Ten percent of people with psoriasis\nhave had suicidal thoughts. Some patients become increasingly introspective, isolated, and depressed. Treatments prescribed for the skin\ncondition, such as systemic corticosteroids, can also affect mood.\n But anxiety or depression may be quite unrelated to skin disease, and\nthe potential link between the mood change and the skin problem should\nbe explored in the history.\nDysmorphophobia and dermatological non-disease\nEach of us has a clear idea of how we look, but some individuals have a\ndistorted body image.\n Dysmorphophobia (body dysmorphic disorder) is a psychiatric condition in which patients have an unshakeable belief that they have a major\nflaw in their appearance. If present, the lesion is trivial, but some patients\nhave no visible pathology (dermatological non-disease). Most patients\nlack insight into their behaviour but want a dermatological answer to the\nintractable problem.\n Before diagnosing dysmorphophobia or dermatological non-disease, it\nis important to be clear what the patient is describing and what they are\ndoing to their skin, e.g. picking may scar the skin, hair plucking induces\nfolliculitis. Many inflammatory skin conditions do fluctuate in severity,\nand some, such as urticaria, may disappear completely.\n Ask the patient to grade the skin problem as it is today, with 10 being\nthe worst possible and zero being normal skin. If the patient says it is\ndreadful and gives the problem a grade of 10, yet you can see no gross\npathology, it is likely that your patient is delusional (see E p. 570).\nDelusions of parasitosis\nThe patient believes that he/she is infested and quite often will have convinced other members of the family that this is the case. He/she may\ndescribe a crawling or biting sensation, lumps on the skin, and digging out\nthe ‘parasites’ to provide relief. You may be given a bag or box containing\nspecimens of these ‘parasites’ (fragments of skin scale, crust, or hair). For\nmore information, see E Delusions, pp. 570–1.\n Also see E Neuropathic itch, pp. 548–9.",

    "text": "Preparation\nGet the basics right, and examination of the skin will be much easier.\nYou should inspect all the skin and aim to describe the signs just as accurately as you would signs in the respiratory or cardiovascular systems.\nYou should be able to interpret what you see, and, although you may not\nreach a diagnosis, try to pull together a reasonable differential.\n Explain what you would like to do, and obtain the patient’s consent to\nexamine all the skin, not just the areas that seem to be affected. Ensure\nthe patient is warm and comfortable. You will need to expose the skin,\nbut you can do this in stages, so have a sheet or blanket to hand so that\nyou can cover the patient. Ask if the skin is tender before you begin.\n Remember to examine the nails, scalp, hair, and mucous membranes,\nas well as the skin. Look under dressings, and invite patients to remove\nmake-up, dentures, or wigs. You may need a chaperone, particularly if\nyou are going to examine sensitive areas such as the genitalia. You may\nalso need a nurse to help you with dressings.\nCan you see?\nLighting in most clinical areas is inadequate for examining the skin. Ideally,\nyou should be working in bright ambient lighting that is equivalent to daylight, and you should have access to mobile supplementary illumination\nfor some tasks, e.g. inspecting inside the mouth or illuminating awkward\nskinfolds.\nMagnification\nSome dermatologists use a hand lens or magnifying loupes for close inspection of skin lesions. Magnification can also help to assess the small blood\nvessels in the nail folds—you can use an ophthalmoscope with a drop of\nimmersion oil, but a dermatoscope is even better. A dermatoscope can\nalso confirm the diagnosis of scabies by revealing mites in burrows. A dermatoscope is used for assessing pigmented lesions, but it takes expertise\nto interpret the signs (see E p. 640).\nWood light (black light)\nA Wood light emitting UVR in the long-wave UVA region may be used\nin the assessment of hypo- or hyperpigmentation or some cutaneous\ninfections (see E p. 640).\nRecording the signs\nDraw pictures, or use a body map, to show the distribution of any rash\nor tumours (see Fig. 3.1). It is good practice to record the maximum\ndimensions of any tumour. It may be helpful to record the appearance\nof a rash or tumour photographically, but do obtain consent before you\ntake clinical photographs.",

Try\nto describe a 1° lesion as precisely as possible, and decide whether the\nproblem is predominantly epidermal or dermal. Ask yourself the following questions:\n• How does the rash start, and what shape are the 1° lesions?\n• Is the border well demarcated or indistinct?\n• Is the surface scaly, indicating an epidermal pathology, or smooth\n suggesting a predominantly dermal pathology? Do not be afraid to\n gently scratch the surface of the skin.\n• Are the lesions raised or flat? Palpate to answer this question.\n• What colour is the rash? Does redness blanch with gentle pressure,\n indicating erythema (increased blood in small vessels), or persist\n indicating purpura (leakage of blood from the vessels into the\n dermis)?\n• Is the involved skin hotter or cooler than normal?\n• If there are blisters, what size are they?

Skin tumours are common,\nparticularly in older people, and skin cancer is the commonest of all\nmalignancies (see E Chapter 17, pp. 341–64). Seek a second opinion, if\nyou are not sure about what you find. Do not be ashamed to ask—skin\ncancers diagnosed early are curable. You are in an excellent position to\nmake that diagnosis when you are clerking patients.\n Record your clinical findings as accurately as possible.\nThe examination\n(Also see E Box 4.8, p. 83.)\n• Check all the skin, taking a particular interest in your patient’s back—\n he/she cannot see it.\n• Record the skin colouring (skin phototype) (see E Table 2.1, p. 27).\n• Are there signs of chronic sun damage (see Box 3.1)?\n• Does one pigmented tumour stand out from the others? Take a\n careful look—this ‘ugly duckling’ may be malignant.\n• For any tumour, ask yourself:\n • Where has this tumour arisen—epidermis, dermis, or deeper?\n • What cells/tissues are probably involved, e.g. keratinocytes,\n melanocytes, vascular, fibroblasts, neural, lipocytes, or other?\n • Is it likely to be benign or malignant (might it be a metastasis)?\n• Take a systematic approach to the examination of the tumour—for\n pigmented tumours, use the ABCDE criteria on E p. 354.\n • What colour is it, e.g. brown, purple, erythematous, or a mix?\n • What are the maximal dimensions?\n • Is the outline regular or irregular?\n • Is the surface smooth, shiny (pearly), crusted, keratotic, or\n ulcerated?\n • Is there a punctum? Seen in epidermoid cysts and other tumours\n centred on hair follicles such as sebaceous hyperplasia (see\n Box 3.1).\n • Are there telangiectasia running over the surface (suggests BCC)?\n• Stretch the skin over the tumour between your thumb and index\n finger to accentuate the pearly appearance and borders of a nodular\n BCC, as well as the thready margin of a superficial BCC.\n• Is the edge rolled, undermined, or indurated?\n• Could it be vascular—can you compress the tumour?\n• Might it be cystic—does it transilluminate?\n• Palpate to check the consistency (soft, firm, hard) and thickness\n (depth).\n• Pinch the skin gently on each side—does it ‘sink down’ into the\n dermis?—the buttonhole sign in dermatofibromas (see E p. 342).\n• Is it mobile or deeply fixed?\n• Check the regional lymph nodes if you suspect malignancy.",

    "text": "Scalp and hair\nExamining the scalp is part of the general dermatological examination but\nassumes particular importance in any patient who is complaining of hair\nthinning, excessive shedding, or balding (complete loss).\n Hair loss (alopecia) may be caused by a variety of insults, including fungal infections, drugs, or systemic disease. The loss may be diffuse or localized. Loss manifest by increased shedding may be apparent to the patient\nbut not the physician. Normal hair density may be reduced by as much\nas 50%, before thinning becomes obvious. The loss may affect hair elsewhere, e.g. eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, or body hair (see E p. 94).\n Your findings should help you to decide if the pathology is likely to be\na non-scarring alopecia (you will still be able to see the hair follicles in\nthe affected area) or scarring alopecia (the hair follicles cannot be seen\neasily).\nWhat to look for: the scalp\n• Is the hair loss complete, and/or is the hair density reduced? Is the\n loss diffuse or patchy? Is there any sign of regrowth?\n• Does the hair loss affect particular parts of the scalp, i.e. is it\n patterned? Androgenetic alopecia in men predominantly affects the\n vertex of the scalp and/or the temporal areas. Check the frontal\n hairline (see E p. 480).\n• Does the loss affect white hairs as well as pigmented hairs? White\n hairs are spared in alopecia areata (see E p. 488).\n• Does the scalp appear normal, or is it erythematous or scaly? Are\n there follicular pustules, perifollicular erythema, or follicular plugging?\n• Are there broken hairs? Is the hair shaft smooth or rough?\n• Can you see exclamation-mark hairs (short and tapering to a point)\n at the edge of patches of complete loss—pathognomonic of alopecia\n areata, but not found very often.\n• Do you think there is scarring? (See Box 3.2.)\nHair pull and hair pluck\nTelogen effluvium is a common cause of acute diffuse hair loss (E Box 2.7,\np. 25). The hair becomes less dense, but patients do not lose all their hair,\nand the scalp looks entirely normal. In contrast, radiotherapy or drugs,\nsuch as chemotherapeutic agents, cause growing anagen hairs to fall out.\nConsider performing a hair pull or hair pluck (see Boxes 3.3 and 3.4).\nWhat to look for: the hair shaft\nYou have examined the scalp, but you may also need to look at the morphology of individual hairs.\n The hairs in some inherited ectodermal conditions are abnormal. Cut\noff a sample of a few hairs, and examine the hair shafts under a light\nmicroscope (or send them to an expert). If the hair shafts are abnormal,\ndoes the patient have problems with other ectodermal tissues, e.g. nails,\nteeth, or sweat glands? (see E p. 634–5.)",

    "text": "Box 3.2 Diagnosis of scarring alopecia\n\nThe diagnostic sign is loss of follicular ostia. Use a hand lens or dermatoscope to examine the involved areas of the scalp.\n Other signs will depend on the cause but might include:\n• Epidermal atrophy—shiny, thin skin that wrinkles excessively if\n pinched gently.\n• Perifollicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema.\n• Boggy swelling and inflammation.\n• Follicular plugging or prominent follicular openings without hair.\n• Follicular pustules.\n• Keloidal scarring.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, take two deep 4mm punch biopsies, orientated parallel to the hair shafts, from hair-bearing skin where the disease is active clinically. Ask your pathologist to section one specimen\nvertically and the other horizontally.\n\nBox 3.3 Hair pull\n\nThis test involves gently pulling a group of 25–50 hairs, while running\nyour fingers from the base to the terminal ends. Normally, only one or\ntwo hair shafts are dislodged.\n In active telogen effluvium, a gentle hair pull will yield at least ten\nhairs with each pull. Light microscopy will demonstrate that these are\nin the telogen phase (see Box 3.4).\n A gentle hair pull at the edge of a patch of alopecia areata will also\nremove hairs if the disease is active.\n\nBox 3.4 Hair pluck or trichogram\n\nA hair pluck involves removing a tuft of 10–20 hairs forcefully (use\nartery forceps).\n The hairs are placed on a glass slide, covered with a glass coverslip, and the coverslip held in place by adhesive tape. Long hairs may\nbe folded in a figure of eight to fit them under the coverslip. The hair\nshafts can be examined under the light microscope. Telogen hairs have\nclub-shaped root ‘bulbs’ without much pigment. Growing anagen hairs\nhave much smaller root bulbs. These bulbs tend to be soft and easily\ndistorted, and they may have tissue adhering to them (root sheaths).\n The normal anagen/telogen ratio is 4:1. In telogen effluvium, the\nratio is decreased or reversed. More than 25% of the hairs may be in\ntelogen.",

    "text": "Nails\nInspection of fingernails and toenails is an important part of the physical\nexamination. Inspect the nail fold, nail plate, and nail bed (see Fig. 3.3).\n Acquired changes may be a manifestation of drugs or systemic disease.\nCongenital problems may indicate a more widespread ectodermal problem that might also affect hair, teeth, and sweating. Nails may be partially\nabsent, misshapen, or totally lost (see E p. 634).\nEquipment\nSide-lighting makes it easier to pick up changes in the surface of the nail\nplate. Consider magnification with an ophthalmoscope or a dermatoscope to look at the blood vessels in the nail fold.\nWhat to look for\nInspect:\n• Nail folds, both lateral and proximal. Is there erythema or swelling?\n• Blood vessels in the proximal nail fold. You will need magnification to\n assess blood vessels, e.g. dermoscopy (see E p. 38).\n• Cuticle: is this present, intact, and firmly attached to the nail plate?\n• Shape of the nail plates.\n• Colour of the nail plates: punctate white areas are common in normal\n individuals; linear splinter haemorrhages near the distal free edge\n of the nail plate in one or two nails may be a sign of trauma. Is any\n colour change uniform, or does it involve part of the nail?\n• Surface of the nail plates: longitudinal grooves are common in the\n elderly, when they are of no significance.\n• Thickness of the nail plates.\n• Attachment of the nail plate to the underlying nail bed. Separation\n (onycholysis) may be caused by problems such as psoriasis.\n• Nail beds (look beneath the nail plate). Is there hyperkeratosis or a\n tumour such as a subungual wart?\nInterpretation\nWhich nails are involved?\nThe distribution of the nail problem, just as in the skin, will provide\nsome guide to the likely cause. If the abnormality is widespread and\nsymmetrical, it is more likely to have an endogenous than an exogenous\nexplanation.\n If just a few nails appear abnormal, particularly if these are toenails,\nconsider whether the changes might be due to trauma or a fungal infection. What does the patient do to his/her nails—biting, manicuring,\ntrauma at work? If infection is a possibility, you may wish to take nail clippings for mycological examination and culture (see E p. 646).\n For more information about the causes of a nail dystrophy,\nsee E p. 96.\n For drug-induced nail problems, see E pp. 380–1.",

    "text": "Epidemiology of skin disease\nThe prevalence of the skin problems that you see will be influenced by\nthe setting in which you are working—hospital or community, rural or\nurban, tropical or temperate, specialty or general—but always remember that common diseases are commonest! Atypical presentations of\ncommon skin diseases are much more frequent than typical presentations of rare skin diseases.\n In the community, you are more likely to come across skin infections,\nviral exanthems, skin tumours, and inflammatory dermatoses, such as\nacne, eczema, psoriasis, or urticaria, than manifestations of systemic\ndisease. Chronic leg ulcers are common in 1° and 2° care, as are drug\neruptions. In 2° care, you may see manifestations of systemic disease and\nacute problems, including conditions that cause skin failure.\n But even in the hospital setting, please bear in mind what is common. Do not forget scabies as a cause of itching when you are caring\nfor patients with chronic renal failure, many of whom are going to be\nitchy; remember fungal infections when you are looking at asymmetrical\nscaly rashes; exclude infection or trauma when you see blisters; and think\nof other causes of photosensitivity, e.g. a photosensitizing drug, before\ndiagnosing LE.\nWhat is common?\n• Skin infections:\n • Bacterial cellulitis, impetigo.\n • Viral: herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, warts, molluscum.\n • Fungal: dermatophyte, yeast.\n• Skin infestations:\n • Scabies, fleas, lice.\n• Inflammatory diseases:\n • Acne.\n • Eczema (dermatitis) of any type.\n • Psoriasis.\n • Urticaria.\n• Skin tumours:\n • Benign.\n • Premalignant (solar keratoses, Bowen disease).\n • Malignant (BCC, SCC, malignant melanoma).\n• Hair loss (alopecia) or gain (hirsutes, hypertrichosis).\n• Chronic leg ulcers.\n• Pigment change (gain or loss).\nPrevalence of skin disease\nIn 1975, the Lambeth Study of 2180 adults in the UK found that 55.5% of\nthem had a skin condition. The prevalence of individual skin conditions in\nthis community is shown on a bar chart in Fig. 4.1.\n In developing countries, skin diseases are a major burden, particularly\nin children.

    "text": "Reaching the diagnosis\n\nThe principles\n• The introductory chapters on history and examination (see\n E Chapter 2, pp. 17–36, and Chapter 3, pp. 37–51) will help you to\n take a logical approach.\n• The history is just as important as the physical examination, but\n experts often take short cuts, using the signs to guide history taking.\n If you are a novice, you should take a full dermatological history.\n• Consider the whole patient, not just the skin—after all,\n dermatologists are physicians of the skin and its contents. Systemic\n problems, such as immunosuppression, malnourishment, or\n rheumatological disease, may have specific cutaneous manifestations.\n• A rash in a patient who is unwell should alert you to a\n different differential diagnosis than a rash in a patient who is well\n (see E p. 58).\n• Check the mucous membranes, hair, and nails, as well as the skin.\n• Remove dressings, so you can see what is beneath them.\n• Integrate the information you gather, and formulate a differential\n diagnosis, using analytical rules as well as pattern recognition\n (see Box 4.1).\n\n Box 4.1 Analytical processing and pattern recognition\n • Reaching a diagnosis depends partly on ordering and structuring\n information (analytical processing) and partly on pattern\n recognition.\n • Experts use their knowledge and previous experience to integrate\n and make sense of clinical information.\n • Pattern recognition (‘spot diagnosis’) is said to be an almost\n unconscious process that involves recognizing similarities between\n cases, based on the overall form of the cases. Expertise is equated\n with rapid, efficient, and accurate pattern recognition.\n • Your skills in pattern recognition will improve when you have been\n exposed to many clinical examples of a condition and thought about\n their similarities. Concentrate on the variations in the presentation\n of common skin problems in the first instance. Why is this likely to\n be seborrhoeic dermatitis, and not asteatotic eczema? What makes\n this venous stasis, rather than a fungal infection? Read around the\n conditions that you see, and reflect on the variations you observe\n with your peers.\n • To develop your analytical skills, adopt an organized approach to\n each case, so that you gather relevant information (experts know\n what questions to ask), detect important clinical signs (experts\n know what to look for), integrate the information, and formulate\n a differential diagnosis. The introductory chapters on history and\n examination will help you.\n • Pattern recognition may have a powerful influence on the eventual\n diagnosis but even experts use analytical rules as a safeguard",

    "text": "Itch\n\nGeneralized itch\nThe history is crucial. You need to decide, for example, if the itch (pruritus, not pruritis!) is a manifestation of a skin problem or an infestation, reflects an underlying systemic disease, or might be neuropathic\nor psychogenic in origin (see E Box 10.5, p. 223, and Box 28.1, p. 567).\nWhat is the character of the itch? Ask about symptoms, such as burning,\ntingling, hypoaesthesia, or hyperalgesia that might suggest an underlying\nsensory neuropathy. How much impact is the itch having on the patient?\nIs it disturbing sleep? Is anyone else itchy? Ask about drugs, including\nsubstance abuse.\n When you are examining the patient, decide what signs are 2° to\nscratching or rubbing (excoriations, lichenification, nodules, ulcers,\nscars) or if you can find evidence of a 1° dermatosis. Patients cannot easily reach the middle of the upper back, and usually this is spared if signs\nare just 2° to scratching. Look carefully for evidence of scabies (and look\na 2nd time if the patient returns still itching).\n1° skin condition—the differential includes\n• Scabies (are any close contacts itchy?) (see E p. 172).\n• Eczema (see E pp. 211–24).\n• Psoriasis (see E pp. 189–207).\n• Urticaria (the rash may have gone by the time you see the patient).\n Ask about the rash and how it behaved. Stroke the skin to test for\n dermographism (a physical urticaria) (see E p. 228, and Fig. 11.2,\n p. 231).\n• Insect bites.\n• LP.\n• Prurigo nodularis (see E Fig. 10.6, p. 223).\n• The prodrome of BP: look for urticated erythema and blisters\n (see E pp. 270–1).\nItch may be 2° to a systemic disease or drugs\nSensory neuropathy may cause itch or contribute to itch in some of\nthese conditions (see E pp. 548–9). The differential includes:\n• Pregnancy-related (see E pp. 584–5).\n• Iron deficiency anaemia.\n• Hypo-or hyperthyroidism.\n• Chronic renal failure.\n• Biliary obstruction, including primary biliary cirrhosis.\n• Polycythaemia.\n• Internal malignancy, including Hodgkin disease.\n• Neuropathic: centrally driven neuropathic itch in association with\n brain tumours, strokes, spinal tumours, and multiple sclerosis.\n Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and diabetes may be associated\n with neuropathic itch (see E p. 548).",

    "text": "Linear patterns and sharp demarcations\nIf a rash is linear or displays a sharp cut-off, consider an external cause\nsuch as an excoriation, pressure of a waistband, or brushing against a\nplant (see E Box 16.4, p. 327). External agents usually produce strikingly asymmetrical rashes. Some inflammatory dermatoses, such as LP,\npsoriasis, or vitiligo, demonstrate the Koebner phenomenon, and the\nrash develops at sites of trauma, e.g. where the skin has been scratched,\nand some cutaneous infections may be auto-inoculated into a scratch,\ne.g. viral warts or molluscum contagiosum. Ask about trauma such as\nscratching.\n Once you have excluded an outside cause, seek an internal explanation, remembering the comment of that distinguished skin pathologist\nIan Whimster: ‘Some invisible intersegmental boundaries, whose existence\nwe have been taught to expect by comparative anatomy and embryology, are\nonly revealed by disease’.\nVenous or lymphatic drainage\nDoes the problem follow a vein or lymphatic? Stand the patient up to\nlook for varicose veins. Conditions, such as stasis dermatitis or vitiligo,\nmay follow varicose veins. Thrombophlebitis presents with tender nodules along a vein. The extending red line of lymphangitis is a typical finding in cellulitis, but other infections, including sporotrichosis, may spread\nalong lymphatics, as may a malignant infiltrate.\nDermatome\nA dermatome is the cutaneous area supplied by one spinal dorsal nerve\nroot. Almost all areas of the skin are innervated by two or more spinal roots, so that adjacent dermatomes overlap to a large and variable\nextent, excluding those separated by the ventral axial line (see next\nsection). Herpes zoster involves the skin in a dermatomal pattern (see\nE p. 156–7 and Fig. 4.2, pp. 64–5).\nEmbryonic ventral axial line\nThe embryonic ventral axial line marks the border between the C5/C6\nand C8/T1/T2 dermatomes. There is no crossover of sensory nerves\nor sensory function along this line that separates the cranial and caudal\ndermatomes. Contiguous dermatomes on either side of the ventral axial\nline are supplied from discontinuous spinal cord segments: C5 and C6\ndorsal; and C8, T1, and T2 ventral (see Fig. 4.2, pp. 64–5).\n Some morbilliform drug eruptions show a sharp ‘drug line’ that corresponds to this axial line, with well-demarcated involvement of the T1,\nT2, T3 spinal nerve dermatomes, but sparing of the adjacent C5 nerve\ndermatome.\nPigmentary demaration lines (Voigt–Futcher lines)\n(see E Box 1.5, p. 13.)\n The demarcation between darker dorsal and paler ventral surfaces is\napparent in about 20% of people with dark skin. Pigmentary demarcation lines in the upper limb that correspond to the ventral axial line (see",

The lines are\nnormal variants in skin colour that may appear pathological.\nBlaschko lines\nThese lines seem to correspond to the pathways followed by keratinocytes migrating from the neural crest during embryogenesis. Dermatoses\nfollowing Blaschko lines suggest keratinocyte mosaicism (see E pp.\n620–1, Fig. 32.1, p. 621, and inside back cover). The lines follow a V shape\nover the spine, an S shape on the front and sides of the trunk that is unlike\ndermatomes, and a linear pattern on the limbs.\n A number of inflammatory conditions can follow Blaschko lines, including lichen striatus (self-limiting inflammatory rash of childhood), linear LP,\ninflammatory linear verrucous epidermal naevus (ILVEN), and blashkitis (Blaschko dermatitis)—a rare, self-limiting linear or whorled itching\nerythematous papulovesicular eruption on the trunk and limbs that may\nbe the adult equivalent of lichen striatus. Rare inherited conditions with\ncutaneous features following Blaschko lines include incontinentia pigmenti and Goltz syndrome (see E pp. 636–7).\nEmbryonic cleft\nCongenital anomalies in the midline may be associated with the lines of\nfusion between embryonic tissues.\nWallace line\nThis demarcation line marks the anatomical boundary on the lateral\naspect of the palms and soles where the glabrous (i.e. skin devoid of\nhair) plantar or palmar skin meets hair-bearing dorsal skin. Some inflammatory problems involving the palms or soles, such as LP, pompholyx\n(vesicular eczema), or the erythematous rash of Kawasaki disease display\na sharp cut-off at the Wallace line.\nLanger lines of cleavage\nsee E p. 8.\nFurther reading\nLee MW et al.

Look for swelling and\n tenderness, as well as erythema. The rash is often asymmetrical.\n• Contact dermatitis: is the skin itchy or scaly? Is the face swollen? Any\n vesicles? Might this be an acute contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic)\n to a cosmetic? Remember that the product may have been used for\n some time before the patient is sensitized (see E pp. 214–16).\n• Acne: pustules, papules, comedones, nodules, scars (see E pp. 242–7).\n• Rosacea: pustules, as well as telangiectasia, erythema, and swelling,\n but some patients have much more of one component than another.\n Comedones are not a feature of rosacea (see E pp. 254–5, and\n Box 12.3, p. 247). Morbihan disease (late-stage rosacea)—look for\n persistent erythema and solid oedema of upper 2/3 of the face.\n• Herpes simplex or herpes zoster: any prodrome of tingling or\n discomfort? Look for vesicles progressing to small pustules. Herpes\n zoster presents in a dermatomal distribution.\n• Corticosteroid-induced acneiform rash: prolonged application of potent\n topical corticosteroids to the face can produce a telangiectatic\n rosacea-like eruption with pustules, but no comedones.\n• Angio-oedema: usually transient. Swelling more marked than\n erythema. Mucous membranes may be affected (see E p. 104).\n Subcutaneous emphysema (rare complication of dental treatment)\n may cause periorbital swelling, mimicking angio-oedema. Check for\n crepitation.\n• Photosensitivity: what is the distribution of the redness? Check the eyelids,\n under the hair, behind the ears, and under the chin. Compare exposed\n and covered sites (see Box 4.6 and E p. 28 and p. 324).\n• Flushing: if repeated, may become fixed. Investigation is only required\n if flushing is of sudden onset and associated with systemic symptoms\n (see E Box 24.7, p. 521). Ask about triggers. Consider:\n • Blushing: flushing triggered by emotions.\n • Physiological flushing after exercise, heat, hot drinks, alcohol.\n • Menopausal hot flushes (flashes).\n • Rosacea: labile flushing progresses to fixed oedematous erythema,\n telangiectasia, and pustules (see E pp. 254–5).\n • Carcinoid syndrome (very rare): look for rosacea-like vascular\n changes, oedema and induration of the face, wheezing, severe\n diarrhoea, hypotension and tachycardia, features of pellagra (scaly\n sun-exposed skin, glossitis, angular stomatitis) (see E pp. 520–1).\n• Superior vena cava obstruction: the face is swollen and red. Look\n for dilated veins on the neck, chest, and arms. Symptoms include\n dyspnoea, cough, and headache.

Take swabs\n to exclude a streptococcal infection. May complicate an irritant\n dermatitis (see E p. 166).\n• Dermatophyte infection: the rash gradually spreads out from the\n flexure. Look for scale at the edge of the erythematous patch. Tinea\n cruris (groin) is common. Infection is often asymmetrical. Take a\n scraping from the scaly margin to confirm the diagnosis (see\n E p. 164).\n• Seborrhoeic dermatitis: look for ‘dandruff’ in the scalp (ill-defined\n diffuse scaling) and behind the ears, or erythematous, greasy, scaly\n plaques in the centre of the face, centre of the chest, or centre\n of the back. The features overlap with those of flexural psoriasis\n (sebopsoriasis).

    "text": "Box 4.8 Skin checks and skin cancer\n\nSkin cancers are the commonest malignancy. You should carry out a\nfull skin examination when assessing patients. But cutaneous tumours\nare common, and you need to ‘get your eye in’, so you know when to\nrefer. For more information, see E Chapter 17, pp. 341–63. These\npointers may be helpful:\n• Patients with fair skin who burn in the sun are at greatest risk\n of skin cancers. Chronic immunosuppression with drugs, such\n as azathioprine, or chronic photosensitivity greatly increase the\n chances of developing skin cancer (see E p. 346).\n• Most skin cancers grow slowly, an important exception being\n nodular malignant melanoma.\n• BCCs and malignant melanomas are usually painless, but some\n SCCs may be tender, particularly on the ear.\n• Most malignant melanomas arise de novo, and not from a preexisting melanocytic naevus.\n• Carry out a skin check in all patients. Examine sun-exposed skin on\n the face, bald scalp, ears, forearms, and back of the hands. Look at\n the skin on the back and legs, and check behind the ears.\n• Look for signs of chronic sun damage, e.g. mottled pigmentation,\n telangiectasia, yellowing, wrinkling, and keratoses (see E Box 3.1,\n p. 43). The more sun damage, the greater the likelihood of\n developing a skin cancer—eventually.\n• Remember deeply tanned skin is generally unhappy skin!\n• Solar keratoses are common and do not need treatment, unless the\n keratosis is thickened (indurated) when you should suspect an SCC.\n But solar keratoses do indicate too much sun exposure, and you\n should advise your patient accordingly.\n• Put the skin on the stretch to see the pearly border of a BCC (the\n commonest skin cancer).\n• Think again before you diagnose melanocytic naevus in an elderly\n patient. Benign melanocytic naevi, common in youth, gradually\n regress with age. A pigmented tumour in an elderly patient is much\n more likely to be a seborrhoeic wart (raised, well-defined margin,\n ‘stuck-on’ appearance, rough with a pitted, crinkled surface) or a\n solar lentigo (flat, smooth, even pigmentation), but it just might be a\n malignant melanoma.\n• Use the ABCDE criteria (see E p. 354) to assess the likelihood of\n any pigmented lesion being a malignant melanoma, and remember\n to look twice at moles that stand out from their neighbours—the\n ‘ugly ducklings’.\n• Record your findings, including the presence of sun damage and the\n fact that you carried out a skin check.\n• Advise patients how to protect their skin from sun damage to\n minimize the risk of skin cancer. But temper your advice with a\n little common sense—we all need some sun to lift our spirits and\n maintain our vitamin D levels! (See E pp. 346–7.)",

Pigmentary disorders may be particularly distressing and disfiguring.\n• Traditional medicines, cultural practices, or cosmetics may affect the\n skin, so ask what the patient is using on the skin.\n• Pigmentary demarcation lines may simulate pathology (see\n E Box 1.5, p. 13).\n• Benign melanocytic naevi are common in the nail bed of black\n patients and produce hyperpigmented linear bands of varying width\n in the nail plate. These may be single or multiple, and their number\n tends to increase with age. Pigment does not extend onto the skin\n of the surrounding nail fold, although some pigment may be visible\n beneath the translucent cuticle. If pigment is detected in the nail fold\n (Hutchinson sign), arrange a biopsy to exclude malignant melanoma.\n• Some black patients have harmless diffuse nail pigmentation.\n• Palms and soles are paler than the rest of the skin in dark-skinned\n patients.\n• Palmar creases tend to be hyperpigmented and, in black patients, may\n contain punctate conical pits (keratosis punctata).\n• Asymptomatic hyperpigmented macules varying in shape and size are\n common on plantar surfaces in black patients, particularly the ball of\n the foot and the heel.\n• Brown pigmentation of the oral mucosa, including the tongue, buccal\n mucosa, and palate, is a normal finding in many black patients.\n• Gingival tattooing (blue-grey) is common in parts of Africa.\n• Periorbital hyperpigmentation is common in the Indo-Asian\n population.

Triggered by ingrowing hairs.\n• Atopic eczema in a follicular pattern is common in black children, as\n is follicular accentuation in other inflammatory conditions, including\n lichen planus and pityriasis versicolor.\n• Disseminated and recurrent infundibulofolliculitis: itchy follicular\n papules on the chest, back, and buttocks of black patients.\nDarker colour (often post-inflammatory) (Also see E p. 88.)\n• Scaly plaques of psoriasis look blue-black, rather than red.\n• LP presents with deeply coloured purple papules in dark skin. LP\n pigmentosa is commoner in Asian patients and presents with ashy\n grey macules.\n• Pseudo-acanthosis nigricans: hyperpigmentation, velvety thickening,\n and skin tags in the flexures of obese Asian patients. Associated\n with diabetes and insulin resistance (see E pp. 466–7).\n• Macular amyloidosis: itchy rash with rippled grey-brown\n pigmentation, often on the upper back. Commoner in Asian\n patients (see E Box 23.3, p. 497).\n• Acquired ochronosis: hyperpigmentation caused by skin-lightening\n creams containing hydroquinone.\n• Suction cups used in the traditional practice of cupping leave\n circular hyperpigmented macules that may simulate bruising.\nPaler colour (often post-inflammatory) (Also see E pp. 89–90.)\n• Pityriasis alba: pale oval patches and fine scale. Most often on the face\n but may involve the trunk. Seen in prepubertal children (see E p. 89).\n• Trichrome vitiligo: zones of hypopigmentation, as well as\n depigmentation and normal pigmentation.\n• Leprosy produces anaesthetic macules (see E Box 6.8, p. 145).\n• Dyspigmentation with scarring in discoid LE (see E p. 404).\n• Confetti-like hypopigmentation on the face caused by skinlightening creams containing hydroquinone.\nWounds and scars\n• Sickle-cell leg ulcers (see E Box 15.2, p. 295).\n• Keloids (smooth nodular scars that extend beyond original wound)\n common on the upper chest, shoulders, and upper back.

    "text": "Hair: too much or too little\nThe history and examination in hair problems are described on E p. 24\nand p. 44. Excess hair may grow anywhere there are hair follicles. Hair\nloss may be diffuse, localized, complete (bald patches), or partial (thinning). Scalp may be normal or scaly. Decide if alopecia is non-scarring\nand potentially reversible, or scarring when loss is irreversible (see\nE Box 3.2, p. 45).\nHypertrichosis\nDefinition: excessive hair on any part of the body.\n• Acquired: generalized, most often drugs (see E p. 380). Rarely\n indicates systemic disease, including malnutrition (anorexia nervosa;\n see E pp. 512–13 and p. 572), advanced HIV infection, PCT (see\n E p. 332), POEMS syndrome (see E Box 26.8, p. 540), and\n disorders of the CNS. Localized hypertrichosis occurs after chronic\n cutaneous irritation or inflammation and may develop in association\n with some tumours (melanocytic naevi, Becker naevi, plexiform\n neurofibromas, smooth muscle hamartomas).\n• Congenital: localized hypertrichosis in the midline over the scalp or\n spine may indicate an underlying neural tube defect, e.g. a hair collar\n in the scalp or a lumbosacral faun tail (see E p. 594). Hypertrichosis\n is associated with some rare hereditary diseases, including\n porphyrias, mucopolysaccharidoses, fetal alcohol syndrome, and\n Cornelia de Lange syndrome.\nHirsutes\n• Increased growth of terminal hairs in ♀ in an androgen-dependent\n pattern (normal ♂ sexual pattern)—face, lips, chest, arms, thighs.\n Caused by androgen overproduction, androgenic drugs, or increased\n sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgens (see E p. 474).\nLocalized non-scarring alopecia\n• Alopecia areata: well-defined areas of loss. The scalp is smooth, not\n scaly. You may find exclamation-mark hairs. At first, regrowing hair is\n not pigmented (see E p. 488 and p. 44).\n• Tinea capitis (dermatophyte infection, ringworm): scalp is itchy and\n scaly, and may be inflamed.\n• Hair pulling (trichotillomania): short, stubby hairs (<2cm). Longer\n hairs can be pulled out. Common in children.\n• Trauma: hair may be pulled out when thick scale is removed in\n psoriasis or seborrhoeic dermatitis.\n• Traction alopecia: affects the margins of the scalp where hair has\n been pulled back tightly. No scale or exclamation-mark hairs.",

    "text": "Funny nails\nAs with the skin, the distribution of changes points towards the cause.\nIf many nails are affected (symmetry), the problem is likely to be endogenous; if only one nail is affected (asymmetry), the problem is likely to\nbe exogenous. Inflammation of periungual skin in conditions, such as\neczema, leads to 2° changes in the nail plate.\nCommon or important signs\n• Changes in nail colour (see Box 4.10).\n• Transverse depressions: temporary loss of mitotic activity in the\n proximal nail matrix. Think of trauma if only one nail is affected. Some\n patients damage the nail plate by repeatedly pushing down the cuticle.\n Beau lines affect all the nails and indicate slowing of nail growth in the\n previous 1–2 months, e.g. during a serious illness or chemotherapy\n (see E pp. 380–1). Arrest of all nail matrix activity causes nail\n shedding (onychomadesis).\n• Nail pitting: foci of abnormal keratinization of nail matrix. Psoriasis is\n the commonest cause of coarse pits. Many fine pits occur in alopecia\n areata. May see pits in eczema.\n• Thinning, longitudinal ridging, and fissuring (onychorrhexis): diffuse\n damage to nail matrix. Mild disease is common in older people.\n Also seen with impaired vascular supply, LP, chronic GVHD, and\n amyloidosis. May cause permanent loss of the nail plate with dorsal\n pterygium (adhesion between nail fold and nail bed).\n• Onycholysis: the nail plate separates from an abnormal nail bed. If\n distal and only a few nails, consider fungus, trauma, or subungual\n tumour. How does the patient manicure the nails? Is something being\n pushed underneath the nail plate to remove accumulated debris? This\n will damage the nail bed and worsen onycholysis. Psoriasis may cause\n proximal oil spots or salmon patches, as well as distal onycholysis.\n Also seen with hyperthyroidism. Drugs, particularly tetracyclines and\n taxanes, cause painful photo-onycholysis (see E Box 16.3, p. 327).\n• Subungual hyperkeratosis and discoloured thickened nail plate: fungus,\n psoriasis. Likely to be a fungal infection if only a few nails. Crumbling\n starts at the free edge of the nail and moves proximally. Exclude\n psoriasis by looking for pitting and/or onycholysis in finger nails (see\n E p. 196).\n• Splinter haemorrhages: indicate damage to nail bed capillaries. Trauma\n is likely if only one nail is affected and the haemorrhages are distal,\n rather than proximal. Splinter haemorrhages may develop when the\n nail plate is abnormal, e.g. in psoriasis. Numerous proximal splinter\n haemorrhages are more likely to indicate systemic disease such as\n infective endocarditis.\n• Nail clubbing: associated with systemic problems, including chronic\n lung disease, cyanotic heart disease, IBD, and thyroid disease, but\n may be idiopathic or familial.\n• Spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia): the soft nail plate in iron deficiency\n becomes concave. Children have physiological koilonychia.",

    "text": "Box 4.10 Changes in nail colour\n• Dark discoloration: diffuse darkening or longitudinal bands of\n pigment are common in individuals with dark skin and are caused by\n melanocytic naevi in the nail matrix.\n• Addison disease and ectopic ACTH production may lead to dark\n nails or bands of melanonychia.\n• Does pigment extend onto the skin of the proximal or lateral nail\n fold? Discoloration caused by subungual haematoma (e.g. after\n repetitive trauma such as running) or fungal infection never spreads\n onto surrounding skin, but pigmentation associated with subungual\n malignant melanoma may affect adjacent skin (Hutchinson sign).\n• Onycholytic nails become dark green when the space beneath the\n nail plate is colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n• Drugs, e.g. antimalarials, can darken nails (see E pp. 380–1).\n• Acquired leuconychia: fungal infection, trauma (punctate\n leuconychia). Hypoalbuminaemia, e.g. chronic liver disease, and\n some drugs cause apparent leuconychia in all the nails, because of\n changes in the nail bed, but discoloration fades with pressure.\n• Congenital leuconychia: rare, affects all nails.\n• Transverse white lines may occur after trauma, systemic illness,\n poisoning with arsenic (Mee lines), or thallium.\n• Half and half nails (white proximally and reddish brown distally) are\n a rare sign of chronic renal failure.\n• Yellow nails. Nails grow slowly and become thick and greenish\n yellow in the yellow nail syndrome, which is associated with\n lymphatic hypoplasia, peripheral oedema, and pleural effusions\n (rare).\n• Red and white horizontal bands in HIV infection.\n\nBox 4.11 Abnormalities in nail fold\n• Boggy, swollen erythematous nail fold: most likely to indicate\n chronic paronychia. The cuticle is missing; low-grade Candida\n infection beneath the nail fold leads to ridging and discoloration of\n the nail. S. aureus may cause episodes of tender acute paronychia,\n when beads of pus exude from the swollen nail fold.\n• Dilated nail fold capillaries and periungual erythema are valuable\n signs of a connective tissue disease (see E Fig. 19.9, p. 410).\n• Digital mucous cyst: the smooth swelling in the nail fold produces a\n vertical furrow in the nail plate.\n• Papules in nail fold:\n • Viral warts; periungual fibroma in tuberous sclerosis; beaded\n papules in multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (see E p. 426).\n• Pustules around the nail and beneath the nail plate: seen in\n reactive arthritis (see E p. 208), as well as in acropustulosis and\n parakeratosis pustulosa (both rare and possible forms of psoriasis)\n (see E Box 9.9, p. 199).",

Lifethreatening causes include infections, severe drug reactions, and acute\nGVHD (see Boxes 5.1 and 5.2). Taking a systematic approach to history\nand examination will help to establish the cause.\nWhat should I ask?\n• Explore symptoms, e.g. rigors, sweats, headache, photophobia,\n arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, or diarrhoea. Any mucosal problems,\n e.g. conjunctivitis, sore throat, oral or genital ulcers?\n• Is fever sustained, remittent (elevated each day and returns to\n baseline, but not normal), or intermittent (intermittently elevated\n but returns to normal)?\n• When did the rash develop, and how has it evolved?\n• Any history of contact with an infectious disease?\n• Document a travel history (were any preventative measures taken,\n e.g. vaccines, avoiding mosquito bites?) and sexual history.\n• Explore the drug history (including use of recreational drugs).\n• Any past history of drug reaction, infectious disease, or skin disease?\n• Might the patient be immunocompromised?\nWhat should I look for?\n• Cutaneous signs:\n • Does the rash blanch with light pressure (erythematous), or is it\n purpuric (non-blanching)? Purpura in a febrile patient raises the\n possibility of meningococcal septicaemia (see E pp. 102–3).\n • Is the rash morbilliform (measles-like erythematous macules and\n papules)? Is there any desquamation?\n • Are there erosions (denuded areas where the epidermis has been\n lost), blisters, or pustules? (See Box 5.1.)\n • Is the skin scaly, or is there superficial peeling (desquamation)?\n • Are the palms and soles involved? Is there oedema?\n• Examine the conjunctiva, buccal mucosa, throat, and tongue.\n• Check for lymphadenopathy.\n• Is the neck stiff, or are the muscles tender?\n• Examine the joints for warmth, erythema, swelling, or tenderness.\n• Examine the cardiovascular, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, and\n neurological systems for localizing signs.\nWhat should I do?\nInvestigations will be guided by your findings, but consider:\n• Full blood count (FBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR);\n C-reactive protein (CRP), clotting screen.\n• Liver function and renal function; urinalysis.\n• Blood cultures, wound swabs, lumbar puncture, skin biopsy.\nFurther reading\nLow DE.

Predisposing factors\ninclude surgical packing, contraceptive sponges, post-partum infections, and deep abscesses. TSS is also a potentially fatal complication of\nsmall burns in young children.\n TSS can be produced by other bacterial exotoxins, including group\nA Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella strains.

In purpura fulminans, fibrin thrombi occlude dermal vessels, as well as vessels in the subcutis, leading to haemorrhage, ischaemia,\nand infarction. Purpura fulminans most commonly occurs in meningococcal septicaemia (see Box 5.3).\nMeningococcal septicaemia (Neisseria meningitidis)\n0 Meningococcal infection may cause devastating septicaemia (acute\nmeningococcaemia) and death within hours of first symptoms.

    "text": "Anaphylaxis, angio-oedema,\nand urticaria\n\nWhat is anaphylaxis?\n0 Anaphylaxis is a severe, generalized or systemic hypersensitivity reaction associated with release of histamine and capillary leak.\nCharacterized by rapidly developing, life-threatening airway and/or\nbreathing and/or circulatory collapse, usually associated with urticaria\nand mucosal swelling (angio-oedema).\n Triggers include foods, drugs (see Box 5.4), and venoms (wasp, bee).\nReaction develops within minutes of exposure to trigger, but often no\ncause identified (these are non-IgE-mediated) (see Box 5.5).\nWhat should I look for?\n• Sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms.\n• Life-threatening airway ± breathing ± circulatory collapse that may\n include stridor, hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, wheeze, cyanosis,\n tachycardia, hypotension, reduced consciousness.\n• Skin and/or mucosal changes (flushing, urticaria, angio-oedema)—\n signs may be subtle or absent in up to 20% of reactions.\nWhat is angio-oedema?\nAngio-oedema implies oedema of the deep dermis, subcutaneous tissues, mucosa, and/or submucosa. Laryngeal oedema, which may cause\ndifficulty swallowing and respiratory obstruction, is life-threatening.\n Angio-oedema occurs in anaphylactic reactions. • Rarely, angiooedema is caused by C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (inherited—AD\ninheritance or acquired). These patients do not have urticaria. Angiooedema is usually triggered by mucosal trauma, e.g. dental procedures\nor, in ♀, sexual intercourse. Some patients complain of vomiting/abdominal pain. Prodromal features reported more commonly in women\ninclude fatigue, malaise, and short temper.\n α-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a rare cause (see E p. 462).\n Facial swelling in acute contact dermatitis (see E pp. 214–16) or acute\ndermatomyositis (see E pp. 408–9) may mimic angio-oedema (see E\nFig. 19.8, p. 409).\nWhat is urticaria?\nUrticaria (hives, wheals, welts) is a hypersensitivity reaction that may\noccur in isolation or associated with angio-oedema and/or anaphylaxis.\nWheals are 2° to dermal oedema. They are raised, smooth, erythematous, and itchy. They come and go, leaving normal skin, but generally do\nnot last >24h. Some patients provide a clear history of precipitants, such\nas drugs, latex, or foods (fruit, fish, peanuts), but many, especially with\nchronic urticaria, cannot identify a trigger. Many idiopathic (spontaneous) cases are not mediated by IgE. Allergy testing in chronic urticaria\nis unrewarding.",

    "text": "Skin failure\n\nWhat is skin failure?\nSkin failure occurs following sudden onset of a widespread severe inflammatory dermatosis that impairs the normal physiological functions of the\nskin. The stratum corneum may be disrupted or the epidermis may be\nlost completely, leaving a denuded dermis.\n Skin failure has a number of causes but is most often either 2° to deterioration of a pre-existing dermatosis or manifestation of a drug reaction\n(see Box 5.6).\nWhat should I look for?\n0 Patients with skin failure have an inflammatory skin condition involving at least 90% of the BSA. Skin failure occurs in:\n• Generalized scaly erythema (erythroderma, exfoliative dermatitis).\n• Generalized erythema with pustules.\n• Widespread blistering, with or without loss of epidermis.\nThe other features of skin failure may include:\n• Cutaneous pain or widespread itching.\n• Impaired temperature regulation: hypo- or hyperthermia. Heat is lost\n due to increased dermal blood flow. Patients feel cold and shiver to\n raise the temperature.\n• Infection (the skin barrier is disrupted).\n• Loss of fluid (4 or 5L of fluid are lost each day if 50% of the BSA is\n involved and the stratum corneum is destroyed).\n• Loss of electrolytes and protein.\n• Increased energy requirements.\n• Oedema (vasodilated cutaneous blood vessels are more permeable).\n• High-output cardiac failure (particularly in the elderly).\n• Mucosal ulceration in some blistering disorders makes eating or\n drinking painful.\n• Hair and nails may be lost acutely or 2–3 months later.\nCauses of skin failure should be explored, and treatment directed towards\ntreating the underlying disease and relieving discomfort (see Boxes 5.6\nand 5.7). Skin failure may be life-threatening—patients may develop\ninfection, hypothermia, or cardiac failure. Older patients, patients with\nextensive skin involvement, and those already taking corticosteroids/\nimmunosuppressants are at risk of life-threatening complications.",

    "text": "Management in Stevens–Johnson\nsyndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis\n\n3 What should I do?\n• Withdraw all drugs started in the last 4 weeks.\n• Take a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Ensure the specimen\n includes the epidermis, which may detach during the procedure. The\n histology shows full-thickness epidermal necrosis in the roof of blisters.\n• Rapid information about the level of blistering to differentiate TEN from\n SSSS may be obtained by detaching the roof of a blister, rolling this up\n gently, and freezing in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections of the epidermis\n can be stained immediately. A Tzank preparation (see E p. 647) can\n also be used to differentiate TEN from SSSS (see E p. 112).\n• Calculate the SCORTEN (see Box 5.19).\n• 0 Involve a multidisciplinary team, and remind those caring for the\n patient that TEN is associated with less oedema, less fluid loss, and\n less vascular damage than a severe burn. Do not overload with fluids\n (see Box 5.18).\n\n Box 5.18 Management—essentially supportive\n • Admit to intensive care unit (ICU), high-dependency unit (HDU),\n or burn unit (familiar with TEN), particularly if significant skin loss.\n • Relieve pain with regular paracetamol and oral opiates—avoid NSAIDs.\n Use a VAS to assess pain in all conscious patients daily.\n • Establish peripheral venous access through non-affected skin, if\n possible, and change every 48h.\n • Central venous lines—risk of infection but can be useful for\n haemodynamic monitoring.\n • Nutrition: nasogastric (NG) tube (Dobhoff). Avoid total parenteral\n nutrition (TPN). Provide continuous enteral nutrition—deliver up\n to 25kcal/kg/day in early phase, and increase to 30kcal/kg/day in\n anabolic recovery phase.\n • Proton pump inhibitor in acute phase to protect GI mucosa.\n • Foley catheter: keep urine output at 40–60mL/h.\n • Fluids: do not overload. Pulmonary oedema is a frequent\n complication because of impaired alveolar barrier.\n • Nurse on an air mattress (air fluidized beds increase transepidermal\n loss of water and heat); use non-stick sheets and heating blankets;\n keep ambient room temperature at 30–32°C.\n • Skin: protect with 50% white soft paraffin in liquid paraffin, e.g.\n Emollin spray®, and non-adherent dressings, e.g. Mepitel®/\n Mepilex®, or wrap the patient with Sofsorb™ impregnated with\n 0.5% silver nitrate solution.\n • Prevent infection: reverse barrier-nursing; culture multiple skin\n sites, sputum, blood, and urine. Repeat every 3 days to guide\n therapy in the event of sepsis. Avoid prophylactic antibiotics.\n • Eyes: 2-hourly application of lubricants e g hypromellose eye drops;",

Pustules may indicate infection, e.g. staphylococcal folliculitis (pustules associated with hair follicles), but, in most infections, pustules are\ngrouped, localized, and asymmetrical. For causes of widespread symmetrical pustular eruptions in sick patients, see Box 5.24.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Is the patient ill, e.g. high fever, malaise?\n• What is the 1° lesion—is it really a pustule, i.e. a bump filled with\n creamy fluid, or is it a vesicle, i.e. a bump filled with clear serous fluid\n that evolves into a pustule (as in VZV infection)?\n• Distribution: symmetrical (endogenous cause) or asymmetrical?\n• How do pustules evolve? What is the time course?\n• Are pustules associated with hair follicles, i.e. is it a folliculitis?\n• Erythema, oedema, desquamation, or mucosal involvement.\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)\nOver 90% of cases are drug-induced. Usually takes 1–3 weeks for rash to\ndevelop, but patients who are sensitized may develop AGEP within a few\nhours of exposure to the drug—for signs, see Box 5.25. May be difficult\nto distinguish from generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP).\nWhat should I do?\n• Reassure the patient and medical and nursing staff that this is a selflimiting condition and is not an infection.\n• Culture blood and skin—these are sterile.\n• Take a skin biopsy (shows subcorneal pustules).\n• Stop the causative drug, most often an antibacterial.\n• Prescribe an emollient, e.g. 50% WSP in liquid paraffin, a mild topical\n corticosteroid, and a sedating antihistamine to relieve discomfort.\nGeneralized pustular psoriasis\n0 Some patients have a history of psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis. Pustular\npsoriasis may be triggered by irritation of the skin, infections, withdrawal\nof systemic corticosteroids or drugs (lithium), but the trigger may not be\nidentified.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nSkin flora\nSkin creases, surface scale, and deep follicular orifices provide just what\nis needed for the survival of a wide variety of microflora. Conditions\nvary—the skin may be dry, greasy, or moist, the temperature warm or\ncool, the blood supply good or poor, and the surface intact or ulcerated.\nThe environment and the host immune response modify the density and\ndiversity of colonization in individuals.\n Resident colonizing species include a mixture of staphylococci, micrococci, and diphtheroids, as well as yeasts. These maintain a viable\nreproducing population on the skin and help to defend the skin against\npathogens. In some circumstances, overgrowth of the normal skin\nmicroflora is linked to problems, e.g. Propionibacterium acnes in the hair\nfollicles in acne.\n Some people carry Staphylococcus aureus in the nostrils, perineum, or\naxillae (see Box 6.1). Staphylococci also colonize the skin in diseases, such\nas atopic eczema, when large numbers of organisms may be shed with\nthe scale. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) may be carried asymptomatically but, like methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), may also cause\ncutaneous infections (impetigo—see Fig. 6.1, folliculitis, ‘boils’). MRSA is\nresistant to β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins (see Box 6.2). MRSA decolonization aims to reduce risks of autoinfection and transmission.\n Prescribe antimicrobials with care (Right Drug, Right Dose, Right\nTime, Right Duration) to limit the development of antimicrobial resistance (a global problem) and to reduce the threat of untreatable infections.

    "text": "Folliculitis and furunculosis\n\nWhat is folliculitis?\nFolliculitis is inflammation of hair follicles (see Box 6.3). S. aureus is the\ncommonest cause of a bacterial folliculitis. P. aeruginosa may cause folliculitis after hot tubs or whirlpools. Superficial bacterial folliculitis is usually self-limiting but may be recurrent. Deeper folliculitis involving the\nentire follicle and surrounding tissues (furunculosis) heals with scarring\nor can progress to cellulitis. Community-acquired strains of S. aureus carrying genes that encode the neutrophil cytotoxin Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL) cause numerous deep furuncles, abscesses, cellulitis, and\nnecrotizing pneumonia in healthy young adults and children. Severe and\nrecurrent staphylococcal skin disease, which is difficult to treat, is leading\nto more hospital admissions.\nWhat may predispose to bacterial folliculitis\nor furunculosis?\n(The evidence is inconclusive.)\n• Occlusion or maceration; tropical climates.\n• Hot tubs or whirlpools (P. aeruginosa folliculitis).\n• Crowded living conditions, poor hygiene, malnutrition.\n• Diabetes, alcoholism, immunodeficiency, or oral corticosteroids.\n• Blood dyscrasias and disorders of neutrophil function.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Superficial folliculitis may be itchy; deep folliculitis is tender.\n• Perifollicular erythematous papules or small pustules—the pustule\n may be pierced by a hair.\n• Crusting of follicular openings when pustules rupture.\n• Tender, inflamed furuncles (‘boils’) with abscesses in deep infection.\n• Furuncles may discharge and heal with scarring.\n• A group of deeply infected follicles leading to a tender erythematous\n nodule—a carbuncle. Pus discharges from several points.\n• Follicular pustules or papules 8–48h after exposure to hot tub or\n whirlpool at sites covered by bathing suit (P. aeruginosa folliculitis).\nWhat should I do in bacterial folliculitis?\n• Remove or minimize precipitating factors.\n• Antiseptic washes are all that is needed in most superficial cases.\n• If folliculitis does not settle, take swabs for culture from pustules.\n• Alcohol-based washes or triclosan are effective against MRSA and\n strains of Staphylococcus producing PVL.\n• Topical antibiotics, e.g. 2% mupirocin ointment, clindamycin lotion, or\n erythromycin lotion may be indicated.\n• Deep infection requires oral anti-staphylococcal antibiotics.\n• Carbuncles should be incised and drained surgically.\nHow should I manage recurrent cutaneous bacterial\ninfections?",

Toxins disrupt adhesion between\n keratinocytes in the superficial epidermis within an area of infection\n by cleaving a specific desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 1. This\n enables S. aureus to penetrate the skin barrier, proliferate, and spread\n under the stratum corneum. (Also see E Staphylococcal scalded skin\n syndrome (SSSS), p. 112.)\n• Factors that predispose to impetigo include minor trauma, including\n insect bites, eczema, head lice, hot climates, crowded living\n conditions, poor hygiene, and immunodeficiency.\nWhat should I look for?\n• One or more areas of golden, honey-coloured crusting and oozing\n (see Fig. 6.1).\n• Thin-walled, flaccid blisters that rupture rapidly, because epidermal\n cleavage is superficial, just below the stratum corneum.\n• Patients with localized impetigo do not have systemic symptoms.\n• Several members of the family may be affected.\nWhat should I do?\n• Take skin swabs from crusted skin for culture (in SSSS, swabs from\n the erythema and blisters will be sterile, as the signs are caused by\n the circulating toxin, and not local infection) (see E p. 112).\n• A topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid or mupirocin, is sufficient\n in patients with a small focus of infection. In more widespread or\n recurrent infections, prescribe an oral antibiotic such as flucloxacillin\n or erythromycin—alter according to sensitivities.\n• The focus of infection in SSSS (see E pp. 136–7) should be treated\n with an oral antibiotic.\n• Antiseptic wash may be helpful in patients with recurrent impetigo.\nToxin-mediated diseases\n• 3 SSSS (Ritter disease) presents in neonates, young children,\n adults with renal failure, and the immunosuppressed. Patients have a\n focus of impetigo caused by the strain of Staphylococcus that releases\n epidermolytic toxins. This focus may not be apparent.

Patients may not be aware of the 1° lesion.\nAtypical presentations may be a sign of HIV/AIDS (see E p. 162). Syphilis\nmay be transmitted to the fetus (see Box 6.9).\nWhat should I look for?\n1° syphilis\n• A solitary, painless, well-demarcated, firm ulcer (chancre), 71cm\n in diameter, about 3 weeks after sexual contact. The site of\n presentation (genitalia, anal, oral, face) depends on the contact.\n• Regional lymphadenopathy.\n• A depressed atrophic scar when healed (in around 8 weeks).\n2° syphilis\nPresents 1–6 months after 1° infection. Rash settles in 1–3 months.\n• Non-itchy symmetrical rash on the face and trunk.\n• Initially smooth red macules, then scaly copper-red papules. Scale\n develops later, and the rash may resemble psoriasis or cutaneous LE.\n• Keratotic papules on the palms and soles.\n• Scaly papules on the glans penis or shaft of the penis.\n• Macerated hypertrophic flat-topped papules (condylomata lata) in\n moist skinfolds—perianal, inframammary, and vulva.\n• ‘Split papules’ at the angle of the mouth.\n• Patchy moth-eaten hair loss, loss of eyebrows and eyelashes.\n• Mucous membranes: greyish white oval patches and erosion on the\n palate, buccal or labial mucosa, tongue (‘snail track ulcers’).\n• Headache, low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia.\n• Lues maligna (rare): papulopustular rash that rapidly evolves into\n well-demarcated crusted ulcers.

    "text": "Lyme disease\n\nWhat is Lyme disease?\nLyme disease is an infection caused by spirochaetes of the group Borrelia\nburgdorferi sensu lato. The spirochaetes are transmitted by the bite of\nhard-bodied ixodid ticks. Birds, mice, deer, voles, and lizards are the\nmain reservoirs of Borrelia. Infection is unlikely if the tick is attached\nfor <48h. Lyme borreliosis occurs in forested areas throughout most\nof Europe, but particularly Germany (Black Forest), Austria, Slovenia,\nand Sweden, as well as the coastal areas of north-east USA, the upper\nMidwest of the USA, and the West coast of the USA.\nHow does Lyme disease present?\nErythema migrans is an early sign of localized disease. The rash usually resolves in days to weeks but may persist for a year. Disseminated\nLyme disease may have cardiac (atrioventricular block, myopericarditis), rheumatological (monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis), and/or\nneurological (meningitis, peripheral or cranial neuropathy, myelitis) manifestations. Late persistent manifestations include chronic arthritis and\nperipheral neuropathy. Late skin signs, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (bluish red atrophic skin on the hands, feet, and leg) and borrelia\nlymphocytoma (erythematous, dusky, or violaceous nodule, most often\non the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum), are seen predominantly in Europe.\nWhat should I look for in early disease?\n• Erythema migrans develops 7–10 days after the tick bite.\n• The rash may be slightly itchy. Flu-like symptoms are common.\n• A small erythematous macule/papule appears at the site of the bite.\n• Erythema extends over days to weeks to produce an annular lesion\n with central clearing or a roundish smooth erythematous patch.\n• Erythematous lesions range in size from 10cm to >50cm in diameter.\n• Warm the skin to make the signs more obvious.\nWhat should I do?\n• Discuss how to reduce the likelihood of further tick bites.\n• Take blood for serology if the patient has been infected for >6 weeks.\n Antibodies are not present in early infection. (Treated patients may\n remain seropositive for months to years.)\n• Take a skin biopsy, if a rash is present.\n• Prescribe amoxicillin 1500–2000mg/day in divided doses or\n doxycycline 100mg bd or cefuroxime 500mg bd for at least 4 weeks\n to treat erythema migrans.\n• Some authorities recommend a single 200mg dose of doxycycline\n within 72h of a tick bite, and others doxycycline 100–200mg bd for at\n least 20 days, to prevent Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite.\nFurther reading\nAguero-Rosenfeld ME and Wormser GP.

    "text": "Viral exanthems\n• Measles (rubeola): measles is becoming commoner in the UK,\n because parents have not immunized their children. The child is\n irritable with fever, cough, nasal congestion, photophobia, and\n conjunctivitis. The rash, which is preceded by Koplik spots on\n the buccal mucosa, develops about 14 days after exposure to the\n virus, starting on the forehead and then becoming widespread.\n Erythematous macules evolve into a red-brown maculopapular\n (morbilliform) eruption that is not itchy. Fades after 5 days, when the\n skin desquamates.\n• Rubella: the child is usually well but may have mild fever.\n Erythematous macules and papules appear first on the face and\n neck and then generalize over 48h. Fades within 2–3 days without\n desquamation.\n• Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease, slapped cheek syndrome): is\n caused by parvovirus B19 and occurs mainly in young children.\n Bright erythematous macules on the cheeks are followed by a lacy\n erythematous rash on the proximal limbs that fades within days but\n may recur with heat (exercise, bathing). Children are usually well.\n• Gianotti–Crosti syndrome (papular acrodermatitis of childhood): is\n associated with infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or EBV.\n Discrete red-brown papules develop symmetrically first on limbs\n and buttocks, then the face. The trunk is spared. Papules may be\n purpuric. Fades in 3–4 weeks. The child is usually well but may have a\n mild fever. The prognosis is good, and liver involvement mild.\n• Asymmetric periflexural exanthem of childhood: the cause is\n unknown. The child may have a mild fever and upper respiratory\n symptoms. The itchy erythematous papular or eczematous rash\n affects one flexure, often the axilla, from where it extends onto the\n trunk. It remains strikingly asymmetrical. Clears in 6–8 weeks.\n• Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome): mainly\n affects infants and small children. An infectious trigger is suspected.\n Children develop a persistent fever. Palms and soles become\n erythematous (within 5 days), and hands and feet oedematous.\n Children may also develop a widespread urticated or measleslike (morbilliform) erythematous rash or (uncommonly) an\n annular erythema. After 10–15 days, the skin peels (desquamates)\n around the tips of fingers and toes and sometimes the palm and\n wrist. Other signs include conjunctival injection (in 2–4 days),\n erythematous crusted cracked bleeding lips (may persist for\n 2–3 weeks), oropharyngeal erythema, strawberry tongue, and\n cervical lymphadenopathy. • Cardiovascular disease (pericarditis,\n myocarditis, endocarditis, coronary arteritis with aneurysms and\n stenosis) may cause sudden death. Treat early with aspirin and IV Ig\n to reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysms.\n• 1° HIV infection: morbilliform rash (see E p. 162).",

    "text": "Herpes simplex virus\nHSV is a common cause of contagious infections. The virus causes intraepidermal vesiculation and persists in the sensory ganglia. Lesions recur\nin the same site. HSV-1 causes skin infections and, less often, genital\ninfection. HSV-2 is the 1° cause of genital herpes, a sexually transmitted\ninfection. For oral and genital herpes, see E pp. 280–1. HSV can trigger\nEM (see E p. 111).\nPatterns of herpes simplex virus 1 infection\n• Recurrent ‘cold sores’ common in childhood and adolescence, most\n often on the lips or face, but may affect any skin surface. Recurrent\n infections (see Box 7.1) may cause recurrent EM (see E p. 111).\n• Herpetic whitlows or ‘felons’ (painful erythematous vesicular\n swellings on the tips of fingers) in health-care workers, e.g. dentists,\n anaesthetists, nurses on ICU in contact with lips of patients shedding\n the virus (many are caused by HSV-2). Also in children who suck a digit.\n• ‘Scrum pox’ on the face of rugby players and ‘herpes gladiatorium’ in\n wrestlers—caused by direct inoculation into grazed skin (see Fig. 7.1).\n• Painful gingivostomatitis, lymphadenopathy, and fever in 1° HSV-1\n infection (see E p. 280).\n• • Widespread vesiculation (eczema herpeticum) in patients with\n atopic eczema, burns, and some rare skin problems. Life-threatening,\n particularly in children (see E p. 112).\n• Immunocompromised: larger or deeper ulcers (see Fig. 7.2), satellite\n lesions, prolonged healing time, or systemic infection. May present as\n linear intertriginous ulcers or deep fissures (knife-cut sign).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Does the patient have warning of the onset? A tingling irritating\n prodrome of 4–6h is common.\n• Does the lesion recur in the same place? This is very suggestive of HSV\n infection. The differential is fixed drug eruption, another blistering\n eruption that recurs in the same place, but without a prodrome.\n• Does it scar? Uncomplicated cold sores heal without scarring within\n 7–10 days, but there may be a little residual erythema for some weeks.\nWhat should I look for?\n(See Fig. 7.1.)\n• Vesicles that rupture and crust within 2–3 days and mild tender\n lymphadenopathy. For signs of eczema herpeticum, see Box 7.2.\nWhat should I do?\nFor management, see Box 7.3.\n• If you are not sure of the diagnosis, take a swab for virology. The\n swab must be put into a viral culture medium. Use a scalpel to get a\n little of the blister roof or base, as well as blister fluid, on the swab.\n PCR will give you a rapid result.\n• A Tzank preparation (smear) for an immediate result (see Box 7.4).",

    "text": "Human papillomavirus\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells of skin and mucous\nmembranes; >150 types of HPV have been identified. These cause infections at different sites (see Box 7.9). Infections are transmitted by direct\ncontact, which may be sexual, but the incubation time ranges from weeks\nto more than a year. HPV DNA is widely distributed on skin in the general population. Infection may be subclinical.\nHuman papillomavirus and cancer\nHPV-16/18 are linked to the development of anogenital and cervical\nSCCs. Certain HPV types may play a part in the development of some\ncutaneous SCCs.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Common warts: papules or nodules with a hyperkeratotic\n surface, often at sites of trauma such as fingers, elbows, or knees.\n May coalesce into a plaque (mosaic warts). Filiform warts (tiny\n frond-like projections) are often perioral. Subungual warts lift\n the nail plate from the nail bed. Warts may be widespread in the\n immunocompromised.\n• Plane (flat) warts: flat-topped skin-coloured papules. Side-lighting\n accentuates signs. Common on the face or other light-exposed sites.\n If widespread, consider HIV or epidermodysplasia verruciformis\n (very rare) (see Box 7.9).\n• Common and plane warts may be linear (in scratches).\n• Deep plantar warts: most frequent on weight-bearing skin and may\n simulate corns (see Box 7.10).\n• Anogenital warts: perianal warts transmitted sexually or by autoinoculation of cutaneous warts. Check children for signs that\n might suggest sexual abuse such as bruising, damage to the hymen,\n enlargement of the vaginal introitus, or thickening of the anal margin.\n Giant anogenital warts seen in the immunocompromised.\nWhat should I do?\n• Most viral warts will eventually disappear without treatment, but\n resolution may take time, particularly in immunosuppressed or atopic\n patients. Procrastinate, if at all possible. Explain that, when the wart\n goes, it will not leave a scar. Treatment is difficult, but treatment\n should not cause more problems than the wart itself (see Box 7.11).\n• Immunostimulatory drugs, such as oral retinoids, have been\n advocated for widespread warts in adults, but results are variable.\n Sensitization with topical diphencyprone (contact immunotherapy)\n has also been tried.\n• Anogenital warts: refer adults to a genitourinary physician for\n screening for other STDs. Women should have cervical smears.\n Children should see a paediatrician or genitourinary physician (most\n units will have agreed care paths for children). Topical 5% imiquimod\n cream or 10% podophylline paint can be very effective.\n C id t ti f HIV if id d f i l i l t",

Autosomal recessive or\n acquired in immunosuppressed patients. Susceptibility to certain\n cutaneous HPV infections, mainly HPV-5, -8, and -14. Increased risk\n of Bowen disease and SCCs (UV is a co-carcinogen).\n\n Box 7.10 Is it a plantar wart or a corn?\n • Pinch the skin on each side of the wart or corn gently. Plantar warts\n are tender, unlike corns.\n • Paring a wart will reveal bleeding or thrombosed capillaries (black\n dots). A corn has a uniform glassy appearance without capillaries.\n\n Box 7.11 Treatment of common viral warts and\n plane warts\n • Minimize trauma, e.g. advise patients to stop picking or nibbling at\n the skin around periungual warts.\n • Common warts: regular application of a keratolytic containing\n 10–26% salicylic acid occupies the patient, until the wart disappears.\n • Duct tape occlusion: apply tape to the wart, and leave in place for\n 6 days at a time for up to 8 weeks (probably a placebo, but painless,\n unlike cryosurgery, and does prevent trauma).\n • Buying warts: another folk remedy, probably best practised by an\n elderly relative. At least the child profits from the wart!\n • Plantar warts: keep flat to minimize discomfort. Pare warts when\n the skin is soft after bathing. Most children will not be bothered by a\n flat plantar wart (parents and teachers may take a different view).\n • Cryosurgery is painful. Reserve for adults, unless the child is\n demanding treatment. Cryosurgery can be a good option for solitary\n filiform warts, which seem less likely to recur than other warts.\n • Other surgical options (best for solitary warts) include\n electrocautery, hyfrecation, curettage, and laser surgery, but\n nothing guarantees cure because of latent virus in the skin.\n • Intralesional bleomycin 0.5mg/mL is a painful option.\n • Plane warts: try 0.025% tretinoin cream or 5% benzoyl peroxide\n cream x1/day. Suggest stopping shaving if plane warts are in the\n beard area.\n\nFurther reading",

    "text": "Dermatophyte infections\n(ringworm, ‘tinea’)\nDermatophytes infect skin, nails, or hair. Infections are transmitted indirectly through skin scales or shed hair. Fungi can be isolated from contaminated hairbrushes, clothing, carpets, or bed linen. (See Boxes 7.16 and 7.17.)\nWhat should I look for?\n• Asymmetrical, erythematous, scaly, well-demarcated patches that\n may be slightly itchy (see Fig. 7.5).\n• Lesions expand slowly, often with some central clearing (ring-like).\n Scale is most marked on the outer edge of the ring.\n• Anthropophilic fungal infections tend to be less inflamed than those\n caused by zoophilic fungi (see Box 7.16), which may have raised\n pustular borders. Check for a history of contact with animals.\n• Scale is less obvious in fungal infections that have been misdiagnosed\n and treated with a topical corticosteroid, but treated patches will\n become more papular and pustular (tinea incognito). The active\n spreading edge is still well defined.\n• One or more well-defined patches of hair loss and scale. Zoophilic\n scalp infections are inflamed, swollen, and pustular (kerion). A similar\n reaction may occur in the beard area. Microsporum-infected hairs\n fluoresce bright green under Wood lamp (see E p. 640).\n• One or more thickened, crumbling discoloured nails. Dermatophytes\n are the commonest cause of onychomycosis. Moulds and Candida\n species may infect nails, particularly in the elderly or immuno\n compromised or if other nail damage or peripheral vascular disease.\n Many abnormal nails: consider an alternative diagnosis, e.g. psoriasis.\n• Widespread or atypical patterns of infection may be a marker of\n immunodeficiency, e.g. HIV/AIDS (see E p. 162).\nWhat should I do?\n• Take a skin scraping, scalp brushing, or nail clipping (see E pp. 646–7).\n In children with Trichophyton tonsurans infection, take scalp brushings\n for culture from family members and close contacts.\n• Treat localized skin infections with a topical antifungal, e.g. terbinafine\n cream or clotrimazole cream.\n• Treat widespread skin infections or infections that have been\n misdiagnosed and treated with a topical steroid with an oral\n antifungal, e.g. terbinafine or griseofulvin.\n• Treat tinea capitis with an oral antifungal in combination with\n ketoconazole shampoo. Microsporum canis responds to griseofulvin or\n itraconazole, but T. tonsurans responds better to oral terbinafine.\n• Nail infection is difficult to eradicate, and, after long-standing\n infections, nail dystrophy may persist. Amorolfine or tioconazole\n paints may be effective in superficial moulds, but dermatophyte\n infections require an oral antifungal, such as terbinafine, for 3 months\n or pulsed oral therapy with terbinafine or itraconazole.",

    "text": "Scabies\n\nWhat is scabies?\n• Scabies is a common contagious and debilitating infestation in which\n allergy to the saliva, eggs, and excrement of the mite Sarcoptes scabiei\n var. hominis causes extraordinarily intense itching. Scabies may be an\n endemic problem in resource-poor settings.\n• The mites mate on the skin surface, and the ♂ (0.2mm long) dies.\n The ♀ (0.4mm long) burrows into the epidermis and lays eggs\n (1–3/day) for 4–6 weeks (see Fig. 8.1). These hatch in 3–4 days and,\n within 10–15 days, reach adulthood.\n• Although the patient may have only 10–12 adult mites, itch is\n widespread, severe, and distressing.\n• Overwhelming infestation in a debilitated, old, or\n immunocompromised patient (>1000 mites per person) is known as\n crusted (Norwegian) scabies (see Box 8.1).\n• Scabies is transmitted by close skin-to-skin contact (for at least\n 15–20min), e.g. sharing a bed, holding hands, sexual intercourse.\n• The mites cannot jump or fly, but ♀ can burrow up to 2.5cm/min.\n• The good news is that scabies can be cured—so it is a rewarding\n diagnosis to make.\nWhat should I ask?\n• Where is the itch? The head and neck are usually spared, except in\n the very young, the very old, or the immunosuppressed.\n• What is the itch like?

Inspect your catch under\n a light microscope—the mite will walk around; do not lose it.\n• Numerous mites in crusts and under the nails in Norwegian scabies.\n• If you cannot find mites but still suspect scabies, either treat the\n patient and all close contacts for scabies or (preferred option) reduce\n the inflammation with a very potent topical corticosteroid, prescribe\n a sedating antihistamine, add an oral antibiotic (if required for 2°\n infection), and renew the search next week … setting aside sufficient\n time to do a proper job. Ask the patient to bring close contacts with\n him/her to the clinic.\nHow should I manage scabies?\n• Consider showing the mite to the patient, who may be interested to\n see the cause of the itch.\n• Treat all members of the household and all close contacts (including\n sexual partners) at the same time, even if they do not have\n symptoms.\n• Norwegian (crusted) scabies—treat all those in the nursing home\n or hospital ward if the patient has been there >24h, as well as other\n contacts. Use two treatments 3 days apart.\n• Apply 5% permethrin cream to the whole body, except the head,\n including the fingers, toes, and skin under the nails. In a child <2 years\n or elderly or immunosuppressed patients, also apply the cream to the\n scalp, face, and ears. Leave the cream on for 8–14h, and then wash\n off. Repeat treatment after 7 days.\n• Although the mites die rapidly once off the body, patients should\n either wash all clothes, bed linen, and towels in a hot wash and place\n items in a dryer for 10min on a high setting or isolate items that\n cannot be washed in a plastic bag for at least 72h.\n• Itching may persist for 2–3 weeks after treatment. Prescribe calamine\n oily lotion or a moderately potent topical corticosteroid ointment.\n A sedating oral antihistamine (e.g. hydroxyzine 25–50mg at night) will\n help to relieve the itch.\n• Ivermectin 200 micrograms/kg in a single dose, repeated in\n 7–14 days, has also been recommended for classic scabies.\n• Crusted scabies: ivermectin 200 micrograms/kg on days 1, 2, 8, 9,\n and 15 plus permethrin 5% cream applied to all the body daily for",

Most often, humans are bitten by animal fleas (usually cat or dog fleas), but these fleas do not live on\nhumans and need access to their animal host to reproduce. Nowadays\nhuman fleas are found most often on farms. They live on pigs, which have\nsimilar skin to humans.\n Fleas have extraordinarily hard shiny bodies that are virtually impossible to crush between the fingers or with a hard instrument. They are\nprodigious jumpers—their muscular legs can launch them vertically up to\n18cm and horizontally up to 33cm (see Fig. 8.5).\n Bedbugs are an increasing problem (see Box 8.6).\nPapular urticaria\nThis eruption, frequent in children, is caused by an allergy to bites, usually those of cat fleas. The flea lays eggs on the cat, but these fall off into\nthe bedding (or the sofa) where they pupate and then hatch in about\n1 month. If the cat is not available, the flea is happy to bite another warmblooded creature. Bites cause few symptoms, unless the patient is allergic to the flea’s saliva. Fleas can survive for a year between meals, and\npupae can remain dormant for 2 years or more. Presentation may be\nparticularly dramatic if the house has been empty for a while, no cats\nhave been in residence, and the fleas are hungry.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Clusters of itchy papules on the ankle and legs (the fleas jump up\n from the carpet to the nearest exposed skin). In crawling infants, the\n eruption may be more widespread.\nWhat should I do?\n• Try to convince the patient (or parent) that the problem lies with the\n cat (dog) and fleas. Explain that cat fleas are virtually impossible to\n eradicate, even though the pet has been treated, because the fleas\n are not living on the cat.\n• Prescribe an antihistamine and a moderately potent topical steroid\n cream, such as clobetasone butyrate, to be applied to bites bd.\n• Reassure everyone that the allergy will gradually become less of a\n problem.\n• Recommend treating carpets, furnishings, pet bedding (and the cat)\n with appropriate insecticides and vacuuming frequently (but dispose\n of the vacuum bag afterwards).\n• Recommend washing pet bedding every week, and consider moving\n the pet’s bed to an area without carpets.\nHuman fleas (Pulex irritans)\n• Itchy, dark red papules clustered in small groups (‘breakfast, lunch,\n and tea’) round the waist or abdomen suggest bites of human fleas.\n• Hunt for the flea(s) to prove the diagnosis (see Box 8.7).",

    "text": "Cutaneous larva migrans\nSynonym: creeping eruption\n This parasitic skin disease is caused by hookworm larvae that usually\ninfect domestic animals (see Box 8.8). In their animal hosts, the larvae\npenetrate the skin to reach the blood and lymphatic systems. They\nmature in the intestine. Eggs are excreted in faeces and take about 7 days\nto hatch. The larvae are found on beaches and moist soils that have been\ncontaminated with animal faeces.\n Cutaneous larva migrans presents in individuals whose skin has come\ninto direct contact with the larvae, e.g. walking barefoot or lying on sandy\nbeaches. The larvae tunnel through the stratum corneum into the epidermis but are unable to reach the dermis in humans, because they cannot penetrate the basement membrane. The disease is self-limiting, as\nhumans are a ‘dead-end’ host.\n Cutaneous larva migrans is usually acquired in tropical and subtropical regions, including the USA (south-eastern Atlantic and Gulf coastal\nregions), the Caribbean, South America, South East Asia, and East and\nWest Africa.\nWhat should I look for?\n• The larvae migrate through the superficial epidermis, producing itchy,\n erythematous linear or serpiginous tracks (creeping eruption) (see\n Fig. 8.7).\n• Tracks are often found on the feet but may be found on any skin\n surface that has been in direct contact with larvae.\n• The track elongates 1–2cm per day.\n• Sometimes blisters develop around or within the tracks.\n• Most patients have one or two tracks, but heavy infestations, e.g. in\n HIV/AIDS, are associated with numerous itchy erythematous tracks,\n crusting, and 2° bacterial infection.\nWhat should I do?\n• The diagnosis is based on the history and clinical findings.\n• A skin biopsy is not helpful, as it is difficult to predict exactly where to\n find the larva, which is somewhere just ahead of the leading edge of\n the track.\n• Antihelminth treatment options include:\n • Ivermectin: a single dose of 12mg or 200 micrograms/kg (available\n on a named patient basis).\n • Albendazole: a single dose of 400mg or 400mg/day for 3–5 days\n for widespread infection (available on a named patient basis).\n • Topical 10–15% tiabendazole solution: applied qds for 1 week\n under an occlusive dressing (no commercial preparation available\n in the UK).\n• Treat 2° bacterial infection.\n• Prescribe a potent topical corticosteroid (apply bd) to reduce\n inflammation and relieve itching.",

    "text": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis\nSynonyms: tropical sore, oriental sore, Baghdad sore, bouton d’Orient,\nDelhi boil, Aleppo boil, Chiclero ulcer.\n Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by obligate intramacrophage protozoa that belong to genus Leishmania. Twenty-one species\nof Leishmania can infect humans. The disease is endemic in tropical, subtropical, and southern European countries, including Central and South\nAmerica, Asia, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and East and North\nAfrica. Animal reservoir hosts include rodents, bats, wolves, and foxes.\nBites of ♀ sandflies transmit the parasite to humans.\n Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the commonest type of leishmaniasis (see\nBox 8.9). Presentation is determined by infectivity and virulence of the\nparasite and the host response—some species induce a brisk inflammatory response, while others produce a more indolent disease.\nWhat should I look for?\n• A history of travel to an endemic region: the average incubation time\n is about 2 months, but cutaneous leishmaniasis may not present for\n more than a year after the sandfly bite.\n• A history of sandfly bites (patients may not be aware of bites).\n• Lesions on nocturnally exposed skin: face, neck, arms.\n• One or more painless brownish nodules that may resemble bites, but\n usually do not itch, and slowly enlarge into plaques or warty lesions\n (Old World disease), or boil-like erythematous nodules that crust\n centrally and ulcerate in 1–3 months (New World disease). Ulcers\n may expand to a diameter of 3–6cm.\n• Satellite nodules may develop around the 1° nodule. Nodules may\n spread along lymphatics (‘sporotrichoid spread’).\n• Other members of the family may also have lesions, suggesting that\n the infection was acquired by bites at the same time.\nWhat should I do?\n• Take one or two full-thickness 4mm punch skin biopsies from\n the raised edge of a lesion or nodule for histological examination.\n Histology is granulomatous, but, even with a Giemsa stain,\n amastigote parasites may be difficult to find. Parasite DNA can\n be detected in lesional material by PCR, replacing culture in many\n centres.\n• Make a smear from slit skin scrape, tissue, or aspirate (see Box 8.10).\n Parasites are easier to find in a smear than a biopsy.\n• Culture material: first you will need to obtain the culture medium.\n• Serology: usually unhelpful, because the antibody levels are low.\n• Discuss management with an expert. Most lesions will heal without\n treatment in 3–18 months but leave a depressed scar which may be\n very disfiguring. Patients with New World leishmaniasis are at risk\n of developing mucosal disease. Intralesional, IM, or IV pentavalent\n antimony (sodium stibogluconate) is still the mainstay of treatment.",

    "text": "What is psoriasis?\nDerived from the Greek psor = itch or psorin = to have the itch.\nIntroduction\nPsoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by scaly,\nerythematous papules and plaques. The prevalence varies in different\nethnic groups, but it affects around 2% of Northern Europeans. People\nof any age are affected, and the incidence is similar in men and women.\nSeventy-five percent of cases occur before the age of 46, but some studies have suggested two peaks of onset, between 16 and 22 years and\n57 and 60 years. The disease remits spontaneously in 1/3 of patients,\nsometimes for 50 years, but the course is unpredictable.\nPathogenesis\nThe epidermis in psoriatic plaques is hyperproliferative, and the dermis\ncontains tortuous, dilated small blood vessels, as well as an inflammatory\ninfiltrate of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Neutrophils are present in some\nforms of psoriasis. Dendritic cells contribute to pathogenesis.\n It has been hypothesized that an antigen penetrating a defective epidermal barrier stimulates an immune response, but, although innate and\nadaptive immunity seem to be activated, no antigen has been identified.\nCytokines released by epidermal keratinocytes and activated T-cells\ndrive new vessel formation and proliferation of keratinocytes and T-cells.\nT-helper 1 (Th-1) cytokines (interferon (IFN) γ, IL-2, and IL-12) as well\nas tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, are\npresent in psoriatic plaques. IL-22 and -23 (which activate Th-17 cells)\nalso have a role in pathogenesis.\nGenetic factors\nSusceptibility to psoriasis is inherited—about 30% of patients with psoriasis have an affected first-degree relative. Linkage studies have shown\nthat the genetics of psoriasis is complex (see Box 9.1). Environmental\nfactors may trigger psoriasis in genetically predisposed individuals (see\nBox 9.3).\nPsoriasis is more than skin deep\nPatients with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing other inflammatory diseases that are immunologically mediated—seronegative\narthritis (psoriatic arthritis—see E p. 206) and Crohn disease. Case\ncontrol studies have also shown an increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (see Box 9.2) in patients with psoriasis, possibly related\nto chronic inflammation and circulating inflammatory cytokines, including\nTNF-α. The psychosocial burden of psoriasis is considerable. Anxiety\nand depression are common, and patients tend to smoke and drink\ntoo much alcohol. Treat the whole patient, remembering associated\nco-morbidities, including coeliac disease, cardiovascular disease (see\nBox 9.2 p. 191), hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, peptic ulcer, and\nliver disease.",

    "text": "Box 9.1 Genetics: psoriasis susceptibility loci\n\n More than 40 gene loci have been identified to be associated with psoriasis susceptibility. Psoriasis risk genes or genes that modify the severity of disease may include:\n • Genes for factors that control inflammation.\n • Genes involved in keratinocyte signalling.\n • Genes regulating vascular growth.\n At least 13 chromosomal loci PSORS1–13 have been linked to psoriasis, but no single psoriasis gene has been identified. Loci of particular\n interest include:\n • PSORS1: the major genetic determinant of psoriasis. Located in\n the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p,\n close to HLA-Cw6. Strongly linked to guttate psoriasis. HLA-Cw6\n is a marker for early-onset psoriasis. Early reports suggest that\n this genetic polymorphism could predict the response to biological\n agents.\n • PSORS4: within the epidermal differentiation complex on\n chromosome 1q.\n • PSORS8: overlaps with the Crohn disease locus on chromosome\n 16q. The frequency of Crohn disease in patients with psoriasis is\n increased.\n In addition, susceptibility genes for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have\n been reported in the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, in particular the LCE3 genes. Deletion of LCE3B and LCE3C are significantly\n associated with both diseases. For other rare genetic associations see\n Chandra A et al. (see E Further reading).\n\n Box 9.2 Components of metabolic syndrome\n • Elevated waist circumference: men >102cm; women >88cm.\n • Elevated triglycerides.\n • Reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\n • Elevated blood pressure >130/85mmHg.\n • Elevated fasting glucose.\n Metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of three or more of\n these criteria.

    "text": "The history in psoriasis\nThe diagnosis may be obvious to you (and the patient) from the appearance of the skin, but listen to the patient’s story to help you to assess the\nimpact of the psoriasis and to plan management.\nWhat should I ask?\n• Invite the patient to tell you about his/her skin condition, and then\n ask specific questions, taking a history, as described in E Chapter 2,\n p. 18, pp. 20–1, pp. 30–31, and pp. 32–4.\n• Inquire about symptoms—in psoriasis, these may include itch,\n bleeding from the skin, scaling, showers of ‘dandruff’, or pain (fissures\n on the palms and soles may be very uncomfortable).\n• Find out what helps or exacerbates the rash (see Box 9.3).\n• Explore quality of life—how does psoriasis affect daily activities,\n work, or school? Is the patient prepared to go swimming/wear\n clothing that reveals affected skin? How does other people’s attitude\n affect the patient? (See E pp. 32–4.)\n• Psoriasis fluctuates in severity. How bad is the rash today? Ask the\n patient to rate the severity on a scale of 0 to 10 (worst possible).\n• Explore lifestyle—alcohol intake, physical activity, and diet.\nTreatments/drug history\n• What treatments are being used now or have been used in the past?\n How effective are these—why were they stopped? (See E pp. 30–31.)\n• Patients may have been treated with UVB or psoralen with UVA\n (PUVA) photochemotherapy. Was burning a problem? Did the\n psoriasis respond? How quickly did psoriasis recur? How long was\n each course, and how many courses has the patient had?\n• Is the patient taking drugs that might worsen psoriasis? (See Box 9.3.)\nFamily history\nDoes anyone else in the family have a skin disease? Patients who have\nrelatives with severe psoriasis may be particularly concerned about their\nown prognosis and the risk of their children developing psoriasis.\nPast medical history\n• Has the patient had any previous skin problems?\n• Is there a history of skin cancer (a risk after excessive PUVA)?\n• Is there a history of arthritis? (see E p. 206.)\n• Severe psoriasis is associated with co-morbidities, including the\n metabolic syndrome. Document cardiovascular risk factors—\n hyperlipidaemia, obesity, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes.\n• Is there a history of depression?\n• Does the patient have HIV? HIV/AIDS may trigger severe psoriasis.\nMeasuring the impact of the psoriasis\nThere is a temporal relationship between psychosocial stress and exacerbation of psoriasis. Ask the patient to complete the DLQI to obtain a\nvalidated measure of the impact of the skin disease (see E pp. 32–34).",

The disease may be limited or widespread. Measure\nthe extent of disease, and assess the severity (see E PASI scoring,\npp. 200–1).\nWhat should I look for?\n• Well-defined pinkish, scaly plaques of variable size, thickness, and shape\n in a symmetrical pattern, predominantly on extensor surfaces. Examine\n the elbows, knees, hairline (psoriasis is uncommon on the face but\n often involves the scalp margin), and trunk (see Fig. 9.1). Differentiate\n from pityriasis rubra pilaris (rare) (see Box 9.5 and Fig 9.4).\n• Silvery scaling over the surface of the plaques: this may be thick in\n untreated disease or minimal if the patient is using topical steroids.\n• Bleeding points where scale has been scratched off.\n• Plaques in the scalp: ask about ‘dandruff’; palpate to find plaques.\n Scalp psoriasis is not obvious on inspection, because hair is retained.\n• The Koebner phenomenon: new psoriasis appearing at sites of\n cutaneous trauma, including excoriations or surgical scars (see Fig. 9.2).\n• Post-inflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmentation, e.g. when psoriasis\n has improved after treatment or a sunny holiday.\n• Nail involvement (50%) (see Box 9.5, and Figs. 9.5 and 9.6).\n• Flexural psoriasis—see later in this section (see Fig. 9.3).\nGuttate psoriasis\nGutta is Latin for droplet.\n An acute form triggered by infection with group β-haemolytic\nStreptococcus (usually tonsillitis or pharyngitis) presents in children and\nadolescents. The rash erupts 2–3 weeks after infection and usually\nresolves within 3–4 months. Some patients progress to psoriasis vulgaris.\nGuttate psoriasis may recur after subsequent streptococcal infections.\nWhat should I look for?\n• A history of an infection preceding the eruption by 2–4 weeks.\n• A history of the sudden onset of a widespread rash.\n• Teardrop-sized erythematous, scaly papules, mainly on the trunk.\nFlexural psoriasis and sebopsoriasis\nPsoriasis in moist flexural sites is not scaly and often misdiagnosed as\nfungal infection, but symmetry suggests psoriasis (see Fig. 9.3).\nWhat should I look for?\n• Well-defined shiny, erythematous, minimally raised plaques in\n flexures, including inframammary skin, umbilicus, axillae, groins, and\n natal cleft.\n• Ill-defined erythematous, greasy, slightly scaly skin in the central face\n (nasolabial folds), eyebrows, behind and within ears, and the scalp\n resembling seborrhoeic dermatitis (sebopsoriasis).i",

Atypical\n adult PRP may persist for many years.\n• May be associated with an underlying malignancy.\n• Histopathology is characterized by alternating ortho-and\n parakeratosis rete ridges called the ‘checkerboard pattern’.\n• Treatment difficult—emollients important. Oral retinoids or\n methotrexate may have some impact.\n• Most cases are sporadic. Familial PRP shows autosomal dominant\n inheritance. Both can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in\n the CARD14 gene encoding the caspase recruitment domain family\n member 14 (CARD14) that is important in the activation of nuclear\n factor kappa B signalling.\n• CARD14 mutations and variants are also reported in familial plaque\n psoriasis and generalized pustular psoriasis, depending on the\n mutation or variant position of CARD14.\n• Other types of PRP include juvenile forms (classical, atypical,\n circumscribed) and HIV-associated.",

Signs depend on\nthe location of the pathology—nail matrix or nail bed.\n• Pits: usually small and shallow and irregularly scattered (likened to the\n surface of a thimble); some are deep—best seen with magnification\n and side-lighting. Psoriasis of the proximal matrix leads to a defective\n nail plate, which partially desquamates, leaving a depression on\n the nail surface (equivalent to scale on the surface of the skin)\n (see Fig. 9.5). Similar macropits are observed along the hair shafts of\n patients with scalp psoriasis.\n• Onycholysis (separation of the free edge of the nail plate from the nail\n bed): the nail appears yellowish white with a proximal brownish red\n margin (see Fig. 9.6). Oval spots of salmon-coloured discoloration (oil\n spots). Both caused by psoriasis of the nail bed.\n• Thickening and crumbling of the whole nail plate: caused by psoriasis\n of the entire nail matrix.

Skin on palms and soles\n are thick, so steroids can be used for a considerable time before\n producing atrophy. However, the disease tends to be chronic,\n and use of topical corticosteroids must be monitored. Consider\n alternative therapy if minimal improvement after 8–12 weeks.\n• Keratolytics, e.g. salicylic acid, combined with a topical\n corticosteroid may control hyperkeratotic disease.\n• Topical vitamin D3 analogues or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment may help.\n• Deep fissures—close with quick-drying glues such as superglue.\n• Localized UV light treatment can be helpful (topical PUVA).\n• Acitretin 20–30mg/day achieves control in some patients\n (see E p. 669).\n\nBox 9.9 Acropustulosis and parakeratosis pustulosa\n• Acrodermatitis continua/acrodermatitis of Hallopeau: affects one or\n more digits. Sterile pustules form beneath and around the nail\n plate, which is lifted off by crust and lakes of pus. Nail loss may be\n permanent and associated with resorptive osteolysis. Very potent\n topical steroids or oral retinoids are indicated.\n• Parakeratosis pustulosa: affects a single digit in young children—the\n skin is erythematous and scaly. Pustules/vesicles may be present\n early but do not persist, and changes look eczematous. The nail\n plate lifts up and becomes thickened. The condition is chronic but\n self-limiting. Topical steroids may be helpful. It is uncertain whether\n this condition is a form of eczema or psoriasis.",

    "text": "Assessing severity\nSeverity is a function of both the extent of the disease (impairment) and\nthe impact on quality of life (disability). Impact should be assessed with a\ntool such as the DLQI (see E p. 32).\n Severity may be measured using a global rating (see Box 9.10) or with a\ndisease-specific tool such as the PASI.\n\n Box 9.10 Global assessment\n • Mild <5% BSA.\n • Moderate 5–10% BSA.\n • Severe >10% BSA.\n Measure the BSA using the patient’s hand. The palm and palmar surface\n of the digits = 1% of the BSA. But a simple assessment of the area of\n involvement does not take into account other problems such as itch,\n scale, redness, or thickness of plaques.\n\nWhat is the PASI?\n(See Fig. 9.7.) The PASI is a tool that was devised for assessing chronic\nplaque psoriasis. The PASI is a widely used outcome measure in clinical trials—a PASI 50 means that the patient shows a 50% improvement\nfrom the baseline PASI. The PASI can be used to record the progress of\npatients with chronic plaque poriasis. It is less useful in other forms of\ndisease such as palmoplantar pustulosis and guttate psoriasis.\nHow do I interpret the PASI?\n• Higher scores indicate more severe psoriasis.\n• Although the PASI ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (100% coverage\n in the worst possible psoriasis), in practice, a PASI of 12 or more\n indicates severe chronic plaque psoriasis, and a PASI of <7 indicates\n mild chronic plaque psoriasis.\nHow is the PASI calculated?\n(See Fig. 9.7.)\n• The body is divided into four anatomical regions (head, upper limbs,\n trunk, lower limbs).\n• Redness (erythema), thickness (infiltration), and scaling in the\n psoriatic plaques in each region are each scored on a 5-point scale\n (0 = none; 1 = slight; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe).\n• The area of skin affected in each region is estimated and given a\n numerical value.\n• The final calculation uses a simple formula to adjust the score for each\n region, according to the proportion that the skin in each region is of\n all the skin.\n• The PASI will only take a few minutes to complete, once you have had\n some practice. PASI scoring sheets, which will take you through the\n calculation, are widely available. Online calculators are also available,\n e.g. M http://pasi.corti.li/ or M www.pasitraining.com/calculator/",

    "text": "Approach to management\nMost psoriasis is not life-threatening, but living with psoriasis can ruin\nlives. You are breaking bad news when you explain to someone that he/\nshe has psoriasis. Treatments offer control, rather than cure—psoriasis\nremits despite treatment, not because of treatment. Your assessment\nshould establish the impact of the disease, efficacy of previous treatments, and the extent of the disease. Managing psoriasis is an art—help\nthe patient to find a balance between living with psoriasis and living with\nproblems caused by treatment. For investigations, see Box 9.11.\nWhat should I do?\n• Do not make any assumptions—explore the patient’s expectations.\n Some patients are very bothered by limited disease. You will also\n meet patients with extensive disease who do not want systemic\n drugs. Using the DLQI can help.\n• Address lifestyle. Lifestyle behaviour change, e.g. weight loss,\n exercise, reduced alcohol intake, can be helpful.\n• Explain treatments control, but do not cure, psoriasis.\n• Does the patient want treatment? No treatment is an option—\n psoriasis may scar the mind, but it does not scar the skin.\n• Find out what the patient can manage to do him/herself.\n• Keep the treatment simple. Decide whether to recommend topical\n treatments, UV light, or a systemic drug, or to use a combination.\n• Discuss the likely benefits (including how long it will take, before\n treatment has an effect), and explain the side effects of treatments.\n• Negotiate a plan for management, provide a written management\n plan, and agree follow-up arrangements (see E pp. 30–1).\n• Provide information about psoriasis, including patient support groups\n such as the Psoriasis Association (UK)—available at M https://www.\n psoriasis-association.org.uk/.\nTopical treatment\nsee E pp. 204–5.\nPhototherapy (UVB)\nPatients with widespread psoriasis, including guttate psoriasis, may benefit from a 6- to 8-week course of phototherapy with UVB x3/week\n(narrow band 311nm). UVB may be combined with topical vitamin D3\nanalogues, tazarotene, or systemic treatments (retinoids). Sunbeds emit\nUVA, which is much less effective than UVB and significantly increase the\nrisk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.\nSystemic treatment\n(See Box 9.12.) Methotrexate (weekly dose), oral retinoids (acitretin),\nand ciclosporin are the most widely used drugs. In patients with psoriatic\narthritis, the choice of systemic treatment should be made in collaboration with a rheumatologist. The new biological agents (e.g. anti-TNF-α)\nhave revolutionized the treatment of severe psoriasis unresponsive to\nother treatments (see E Chapter 34 and Box 34 5 p 671)",

    "text": "Topical treatments\n\nGeneral principles\n• Topical treatment is a reasonable option for limited disease.\n• Discuss the likely outcome—control, not cure. Explain that you are\n not aiming to clear, but to make the condition tolerable.\n• Patients need time (and may need help) to apply treatments. If time is\n a problem, suggest concentrating on the most troublesome area.\n• Demonstrate how to apply the treatment—ideally, you will have a\n specialist nurse to help you.\n• Select the right base (usually the one the patient prefers) for each\n treatment—ointment, cream, lotion, gel, or foam.\n• Keep the treatment plan simple—the patient is much more likely to\n adhere to treatment—and prescribe enough of the preparations.\n• In patients with extensive disease, topical treatments can be\n combined with UV light or systemic treatment.\nEmollients\n• Emollient creams (moisturizers) reduce scale and may relieve itch\n partially, but are less effective in psoriasis than eczema.\nVitamin D3 analogues: suitable for limited plaque psoriasis\n• Vitamin D3 analogues (e.g. calcitriol, calcipotriol, tacalcitol) are\n effective, if applied x1–2/day for at least 3 months. Patients like these\n preparations, because they are colourless and odourless.\n• Plaques eventually become erythematous smooth patches but do not\n disappear.\n• Vitamin D3 analogues may be used for short periods in combination\n with a potent topical corticosteroid to reduce the risk of irritation\n (combination preparations are available).\n• Vitamin D3 analogues are not suitable for extensive psoriasis, because\n treatment has to be limited to affected skin, and patients should not\n use >100g/week because of risk of hypercalcaemia.\n• Some vitamin D3 analogues may irritate and are not suitable for the\n face or flexures.\nTar lotion: suitable for limited or widespread\nplaque psoriasis\n• Coal tar 1% lotion applied x1–2/day is as effective as a topical vitamin\n D3 analogue for the trunk and limbs and easier to use in widespread\n psoriasis, because application does not have to be limited to\n affected skin.\n• The lotion can be applied quickly all over the skin.\n• Coal tar lotion may irritate and is not suitable for the face or flexures.\n• Patients may not like the smell, but applying an emollient over the\n lotion reduces this.\n• Liquor picis carbonis (LPC) 10% in an emulsifying ointment is also\n suitable for home use, but it is messier to use than coal tar lotion.",

    "text": "Psoriatic arthritis\nOverall, 4–30% of patients with psoriasis have an associated arthritis.\nSeventy percent of these patients develop psoriasis before arthritis,\n10–15% arthritis before psoriasis, and, in the rest, the two occur within\n1 year of each other. For classification criteria, see Box 9.13.\n Joint involvement is classified into five major clinical subtypes that\noverlap. Most present with monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, but more\njoints tend to be involved in long-standing disease. Erosive and deforming arthritis occur in 40–60% of patients. Simultaneous flares in skin and\njoint disease have been reported, but conflicting evidence about whether\nthe severity of psoriasis is related to the severity of arthritis.\nWhat should I look for?\n• A history of joint stiffness in the morning that lasts >30min,\n suggesting inflammatory disease.\n• Symmetrical polyarthritis that may be indistinguishable from RA\n (rheumatoid factor (RF) negative, no rheumatoid nodules). Look for\n boggy soft tissue swelling in the small joints of the hands, suggesting\n synovitis.\n• Asymmetric oligoarthritis with <5 small or large joints affected in an\n asymmetrical pattern. Look for effusions in large joints, e.g. knees.\n• Psoriatic nail changes are commoner and associated with distal\n interphalangeal (DIP) inflammation.\n• Involvement of the spine (spondylitis) and sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis).\n This pattern is associated with the MHC class I molecule HLA-B27,\n like the other seronegative spondyloarthropathies (see E Reactive\n arthritis, p. 208, and SAPHO syndrome, p. 248).\n• Arthritis mutilans—destruction of the small joints of the hand,\n especially the DIP joints. This is associated with prolonged disease.\n• Dactylitis, i.e. swelling of a whole digit, producing a sausage-like\n appearance (seen in 1/3 of patients). Probably a combination of\n tenosynovitis and synovitis or diffuse digital oedema (see Fig. 9.5).\n• Enthesopathy, i.e. pain at sites where ligaments, tendons, fascia, and the\n joint capsule are inserted into bone, e.g. at the heel (plantar fasciitis),\n elbow (golfer’s elbow or tennis elbow), and the Achilles tendon.\nWhat should I do?\n• Investigations: FBC—normocytic anaemia; leucocytosis in acute\n inflammatory arthritis. CRP, ESR—raised in acute inflammatory\n arthritis. RF—usually negative in psoriatic arthritis.\n• Radiographs of affected joints and sacroiliac joints if low back pain\n sounds inflammatory, i.e. stiffness improving with exercise and not\n relieved by rest.\n• Refer to a rheumatologist if symptoms not controlled by antiinflammatory agents or evidence of synovitis, joint effusion, or\n deformity.

    "text": "Reactive arthritis\n\nWhat is reactive arthritis?\nReactive arthritis is a seronegative, HLA-B27-linked spondyloarthropathy that shares features with the other arthropathies in this group,\nincluding psoriatic arthritis (see E p. 206). Typically, patients (usually\nmen aged 20–40) have a mono- or oligoarthritis affecting the lower\nlimbs. Mucocutaneous signs are common.\n Arthritis develops several days to weeks after an extra-articular infection. Viable pathogen is not detected in the joint (though intra-articular\nbacteria or bacterial fragments have been identified). The common\ncauses of reactive arthritis are genitourinary infections (e.g. Chlamydia\ntrachomatis) and GI infections (e.g. Yersinia, Shigella, Salmonella, and\nCampylobacter). HIV infection is another cause.\n The triad of arthritis, a sterile (aseptic) urethritis, and conjunctivitis in a\npatient with dysentery was described by Reiter as a syndrome in 1916, and\nthe term Reiter syndrome is still used sometimes to describe this triad.\nWhat mucocutaneous signs should I look for?\n• Keratoderma blenorrhagicum: a pustular rash on palms and soles—\n clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from palmoplantar\n pustulosis. However, pustules are followed by gross conical\n hyperkeratosis, which is not usually seen in palmoplantar pustulosis\n or psoriasis (see E p. 198).\n• Nail changes tend to be more pustular than in psoriasis and include:\n • Onycholysis, ridging, and splitting.\n • Brownish red or greenish yellow discoloration of the nails.\n • Small yellow pustules under the nail, often near the lunula.\n • Subungual hyperkeratosis.\n • Nail pitting.\n• Erythematous macules at the urethral meatus and on the glans\n penis. These may coalesce into a circinate scaly, erythematous patch\n (circinate balanitis) (see Fig. 9.8).\n• Flaccid pustular lesions that develop thick horny scale.\n• Well-demarcated erythematous, scaly psoriasiform plaques on the\n scrotum, buttocks, trunk, and limbs.\n• Thick psoriasiform scale on the scalp.\n• Asymptomatic superficial erosions in the oral mucosa.\n• Patches of denuded papillae on the tongue.\n• Bilateral mucopurulent conjunctivitis, acute anterior uveitis\n (photophobia, redness, watering, pain, decreased visual acuity),\n keratitis (corneal inflammation).\nWhat should I do for cutaneous disease?\nManage as you would psoriasis or palmoplantar pustulosis (see Box 9.7).\nTreatment options include moderately potent topical corticosteroids\nand oral retinoids.\n The condition is usually self-limiting, but steroids and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are sometimes required for",

    "text": "What is eczema (dermatitis)?\nThe word eczema, derived from the Greek ‘to break out or boil over’,\nrefers to the vesicles (bubbles) seen in acute eczema. Dermatitis means\ninflammation of the skin. The terms tend to be used synonymously.\nEczema is a cutaneous reaction pattern that is poorly understood, and\nthis is reflected by the confusing terminology used to describe different patterns (see Box 10.1). Oedema within and between keratinocytes\n(spongiosis) may produce weeping, with thin-walled vesicles (intraepidermal) that soon rupture. Eczema may be endogenous (commonest\nform—atopic eczema) or exogenous, but barrier function of the epidermis is abnormal in most forms of eczema, so the skin is easily irritated.\nWhat should I look for?\nEczema is itchy. Patients with acutely inflamed eczema may also be very\nuncomfortable. Endogenous disease tends to be symmetrical, whereas\nthe site of contact determines the distribution of a contact dermatitis. Signs depend on whether acute, subacute, or chronic but include\ncombinations of:\n• Erythema: often ill-defined (see E Fig. 31.8, p. 611) (compare with\n psoriasis which is well defined (see E Fig. 9.1, p. 193).\n• Scaling, i.e. epidermal pathology: may not be present in the early\n stages of acute contact eczema in which the skin is erythematous and\n oedematous (see Figs. 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3,).\n• Scratch marks (excoriations).\n• Papules, oedema, and/or vesicles (occasionally bullae) in acute\n eczema.\n• Exudation of serous fluid (weeping) and crusting in acute eczema\n (crusting may be a sign of 2° bacterial infection, as may pustules).\n• Thickening of the skin, with increased skin markings (lichenification)\n 2° to chronic rubbing (see E Fig. 31.9, p. 611).\n• Prurigo (itchy, erythematous nodules): 2° to chronic rubbing\n (see Fig.10.6).\n• Hyperkeratosis in chronic eczema.\n• Hyperpigmentation 2° to chronic rubbing.\n• Post-inflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmentation in dark skin.\nWhat should I do?\n• Generally, a skin biopsy is not required—the histology will not tell\n you the cause of the eczema, and the diagnosis is clinical.\n• Take skin swabs from crusted weeping eczema for bacterial culture.\n• In vesicular rashes, exclude herpes virus infection. Eczema\n herpeticum may complicate atopic eczema (see E p. 112).\n• Skin scrapes to exclude fungal (dermatophyte) infection in\n asymmetrical scaly rashes.\n• Patch test if you suspect allergic contact dermatitis (see E p. 214).\n• Topical and systemic treatments (see E Chapter 34, pp. 653–71).",

    "text": "Contact dermatitis\n\nWhat is contact dermatitis?\nContact dermatitis is caused by exposure of the skin to an irritant or\nallergen. Irritancy is commoner than allergy. Impaired skin barrier function facilitates penetration of irritants and contact allergens into the epidermis, e.g. in atopic individuals, neonates, or older patients. Exposed\nbody sites are often affected by contact dermatitis. Occupational contact dermatitis occurs more frequently in cleaners, hairdressers, nurses,\nhomemakers, caterers, and builders (see Fig. 10.1).\nIrritant contact dermatitis\nUrine and faeces are irritants—the buttocks and perineum are affected\nin incontinent patients (see E Chapter 31, p. 604). Detergents, alkalis,\nsolvents, and cutting oils are also potential irritants. Some plants contain\nlight-sensitizing furocoumarin chemicals that are phototoxic in the presence of sunlight (see E Box 16.4, p. 327).\nAllergic contact dermatitis\nPathogenesis: delayed (type 4) cell-mediated allergic reaction (see\nBox 10.3). The patient has to have prior exposure and sensitization\nbefore developing an allergic reaction characterized by itching, erythema, vesiculation, and scaling. For common cutaneous allergens, see\nBox 10.4. Always consider patch testing in chronic hand dermatitis, facial\ndermatitis, pruritus ani (when over-the-counter medicaments may have\nbeen used), and dermatitis associated with chronic leg ulcers. Patch tests\nare applied to the back on day 0, removed and read on day 2, and read\nagain on day 4 or 5. An eczematous reaction indicates a positive result.\nWhat should I ask?\n• Take a history, as recommended in E Chapter 2, pp. 20–3 and\n pp. 30–1. Ask about the occupation and hobbies; is the patient an\n obsessive handwasher? (see E p. 566.)\n• Find out what the patient uses—cosmetics, perfumes, hair dyes,\n over-the-counter medicaments, etc. Remember you can become\n allergic to a product that has been used for some time.\n• Explore what provokes the rash. Does the problem improve when\n not in contact with the preparation, e.g. weekends, holidays?\n• Is there a history of atopic eczema (irritant contact dermatitis is\n commoner than allergic contact dermatitis in atopics).\nWhat should I do?\n• Exclude 2° infection, particularly in genital dermatitis.\n• Minimize contact with irritants, e.g. avoid soap, and use gloves.\n• Prescribe emollients.\n• Reduce inflammation with a potent corticosteroid ointment. A short\n course of prednisolone may be needed in severe blistering reactions.\n• Refer for patch testing if you suspect an allergic contact dermatitis.\n• If the patient is allergic to something, any contact with that allergen will\n produce a reaction and complete avoidance is essential An inevitable",

    "text": "Box 10.3 Pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis\n• Abnormalities in skin barrier function may facilitate the penetrance\n of an allergen and make some patients more prone to developing an\n allergic contact dermatitis (see E Box 1.2, p. 6).\n• Topical antigen penetrates the stratum cornea and enters the\n epidermis.\n• The antigen is taken up by dendritic Langerhans cells within the\n epidermis and processed into small peptides. Peptides bound to\n class II MHC proteins are expressed on the surface of Langerhans\n cells. (Dermal dendritic cells may also process and present\n antigens.)\n• Langerhans cells bearing the antigen migrate from the skin via\n lymphatics to the pancortical area of the draining lymph node\n where they activate CD4+ T-lymphocytes.\n• IL-1 released by Langerhans cells triggers T-cells to release IL-2 and\n proliferate, with the generation of allergen-specific memory T-cells.\n These will recognize the antigen on re-exposure and migrate to the\n challenge site to produce cytokines and cytotoxic damage to the\n skin. This results in itch, erythema, and oedema.\n• IL-5 and IL-13 cytokine production correlates with positive skin\n reactions, suggesting that Th-2, in addition to Th-1, cytokines play\n a role.\n\nBox 10.4 Some common cutaneous allergens\n• Nickel: in costume jewellery and jean studs.\n• Chrome: in cement and leather.\n• Fragrance mix: in perfumed cosmetics, soaps, air fresheners,\n household furniture spray polishes, etc.\n• Balsam of Peru: fragrance and haemorrhoid creams.\n• Methylisothiazolinone: preservative in cosmetics, wet wipes, and\n paints.\n• Rubber accelerators (mercapto and thiuram mixes).\n• Epoxy resin: in two part adhesive mixtures.\n• Colophony: adhesive in adhesive plaster.\n• Paraphenylene diamine (PPD): in hair dyes.\n• Parabens: preservative in many creams and lotions.\n• Wool alcohols (lanolin): lanolin in many creams.\n• Medicaments such as benzocaine, neomycin, quinoline mix, and\n hydrocortisone.",

For\nmore detailed discussion of the cause and management of atopic eczema\nin children, see E Chapter 31, pp. 606–11.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Dry, scaly skin.\n• A symmetrical erythematous, scaly rash, worse in flexures.\n• Intense itch with excoriations, nodules (prurigo nodularis; see\n Fig. 10.6), and/or thickened (lichenified) skin 2° to scratching and\n rubbing (see E Fig. 31.9, p. 611).\n• Crusting, weeping, or vesicles suggesting 2° infection (bacterial or\n herpesvirus). Widespread vesicles and fever = eczema herpeticum,\n an emergency, most often seen in children (see E p. 112).\n• Atopic individuals have skin that is easily irritated, and adults may also\n have an irritant contact dermatitis, often on the hands or face.\n• Erythroderma in severe disease (see E p. 108).\n• Thin skin (bruising, telangiectasia, striae) 2° to prolonged use of\n potent topical corticosteroids.\nWhat should I do?\n• Skin swabs for bacterial and viral culture if signs suggest infection.\n• Soap substitutes (containing antibacterials) and emollients control\n dryness and reduce bacterial colonization of the skin. Even though\n the patient may have a long history of eczema, find out exactly how\n the skin is managed, and explain how to use emollients and to avoid\n irritants such as soap or shower gels (see E pp. 30–1, p. 655, and\n p. 662).\n• Prescribe a potent topical corticosteroid ointment to use once or\n twice daily (see E pp. 654–8).\n• Alternatively: tacrolimus ointment 0.1%, but avoid in infected skin.\n• Oral antibiotics or antivirals to control infection, if required.\n• A sedating antihistamine may relieve irritation, e.g. hydroxyzine.\n• A short course of oral prednisolone (30mg/day, tailing off over 2–3\n weeks) may be required for severe acute flares.\n• Consider referral for patch tests to exclude an allergic contact\n dermatitis, particularly in patients with facial eczema or patients with\n no previous history of eczema.\n• Consider skin biopsy to exclude CTCL if the patient does not have\n a personal or family history of atopic disease and this is a new\n presentation (see E pp. 358–9).\n• Courses of phototherapy or steroid-sparing agents (e.g. azathioprine,\n ciclosporin) may be indicated in severe chronic disease",

Malassezia furfur (pityrosporum ovale),\na lipophilic yeast that is a skin commensal is found in large numbers in\ninvolved skin. Reaction to the yeasts may play some part in the pathogenesis. Adult seborrhoeic dermatitis is chronic and recurrent. Parkinson\ndisease and epilepsy predispose to seborrhoeic dermatitis. Patients with\nHIV/AIDS may have very severe disease. Although seborrhoeic dermatitis is not particularly itchy, it is disfiguring. Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis is unrelated to the disease in adults (see E p. 602).\nWhat should I look for?\nOne or more sites may be affected:\n• Poorly defined scalp erythema and fine white scale (dandruff). Hair is\n retained.\n• Poorly defined greasy, scaly erythema, affecting the nasolabial folds\n and central forehead.\n• Fine scaling in the eyebrows, behind the ears, and within the ears\n (otitis externa), and/or blepharitis.\n• Orangey, ill-defined erythema with fine scale in flexures (axillae,\n groin, umbilicus). May resemble flexural psoriasis (see E Fig. 9.3,\n p. 193).\n• Greasy, scaly, erythematous papules in the central chest and central\n back. May have an annular configuration.\n• Follicular papules or pustules over the back and sometimes the chest\n (pityrosporum folliculitis) (see E Box 6.3, p. 135).\n• Normal nails—pitting suggests psoriasis.\n• Erythroderma in severe disease (see E p. 108).\nWhat should I do?\nIt may be difficult to differentiate seborrhoeic dermatitis from flexural\npsoriasis (sebopsoriasis), but the approach to management is similar.\nConsider HIV/AIDS in patients with severe disease unresponsive to\ntreatment. Treatment should tackle inflammation, scaling, and overgrowth of yeasts. Treatment options include:\n• Greasy emollient to use as a soap substitute and skin moisturizer.\n• Hydrocortisone 1% ointment, combined with an imidazole, applied\n x1/day to the face and flexures—combinations of a corticosteroid\n with an antifungal are more effective than a corticosteroid alone.\n• A moderately potent topical corticosteroid may be needed for a\n short time in the flexures, e.g. Trimovate® cream.\n• Topical 0.1% tacrolimus ointment x1/day is an alternative to a mild\n corticosteroid for facial or flexural seborrhoeic dermatitis.\n• Ketoconazole shampoo for the scalp and as a body wash (useful in\n pityrosporum folliculitis)—perhaps x2–3/week. Shampoo is drying\n and can irritate the skin—suggest the use of a moisturizer.\n• Alternative shampoos include preparations with tar or salicylic acid,\n e.g. Capasal®, Polytar®, T-Gel®.\n• A potent steroid lotion applied overnight may control scalp disease,\n e.g. Betnovate® lotion or Dermovate® scalp application.",

The prevalence of autoimmune conditions, such as alopecia areata, vitiligo, and\nulcerative colitis, is increased in LP. Some studies suggest an increased\nprevalence of infections with hepatitis B or C virus. LP can also be\ndrug-induced (see E p. 375). Many variants of cutaneous LP have been\ndescribed. Itching is a common complaint. Lichen nitidus may be a variant\nof LP (see Box 10.6).

    "text": "Urticaria\nUrticaria (hives, wheals, welts) is a hypersensitivity reaction that may occur\nin isolation or associated with angio-oedema and/or anaphylaxis (see E\npp. 104–5 and Box 11.1). Urticaria erupts spontaneously, and smooth, erythematous, itchy swellings (wheals) persist for 2–24h, before fading to leave\nnormal skin (see Fig. 11.1). Some patients have wheals every day; in others, it\nis episodic. The condition may persist for <6 weeks (acute urticarial) and may\nbe precipitated by insect bites, drugs, e.g. penicillin, infections, contact with\nlatex, and food allergies (see E pp. 104–5). It can last for months or years\n(chronic) (see Box 11.1). The underlying mechanism may be immunological\nor non-immunological, but the end result is the same—mast cell degranulation with release of histamine and inflammatory mediators, increased capillary permeability, and transient fluid leakage into the dermis, causing swelling.\nWhat is chronic urticaria?\n(See Box 11.1.) In most patients with chronic urticaria, a cause is not identified, and it is called spontaneous (previously referred to as ordinary).\nHelminth infections should be considered as a cause, and urticaria is also\ncommon in SLE. Children and adolescents with severe spontaneous urticaria have an increased prevalence of coeliac disease.\nWhat should I ask?\n• Exclude physical urticaria by asking about precipitating factors\n (pressure, sun, heat, cold) and how long it takes urticaria to appear.\n Patients who are dermographic may notice wheals appear immediately\n when the skin is rubbed/scratched—wheals last <1h (see Fig. 11.2).\n• What are the symptoms—itch, burning, pain?\n• How long do the marks last? Delayed pressure urticaria may last up\n to 72h. Urticarial vasculitis is also long-lasting (see E p. 443).\n• Is it precipitated by contact with latex or foods, e.g. fish, nuts?\n• What does the skin look like when urticaria fades? Skin should appear\n normal in urticaria. Urticarial vasculitis leaves bruising.\n• Ask about wheezing and angio-oedema: lip and throat swelling\n (see E p. 104).\n• Is the patient taking any drugs that may cause or worsen urticaria—\n opiates (direct mast cell-releasing agents), salicylates, non-steroidal\n anti-inflammatories, ACE inhibitors? (see E p. 372.)\n• Does the patient report symptoms suggesting an underlying systemic\n disease, e.g. fever, arthralgia, myalgia, diarrhoea, weight loss?\n• Is there a family history of urticaria? (see E pp. 234–5.)\nWhat should I do?\nsee E Management, pp. 232–3.\n• Check the skin surface—smooth, not scaly, in urticaria (see Fig. 11.1).\n• Confirm that the rash is erythematous (does it blanch?).\n• Stroke the skin with a spatula to see if the patient is dermographic\n (a wheal and flare appear within 10min at the site of pressure).\n• Check that the skin looks normal where wheals have faded.\n• Are the lips or tongue swollen?",

Chronic spontaneous (ordinary) urticaria\n• Unknown aetiology (idiopathic).\n• Autoimmune aetiology (30%) caused by histamine-releasing\n autoantibodies (routine tests for these autoantibodies are not\n available). May be associated with thyroid autoimmunity.\nB. Chronic inducible urticaria\n1. Physical urticaria\n Reproducibly induced by the same physical stimulus (see E p. 230).\n• Mechanical:\n • Delayed pressure urticaria (swelling may last up to 48h).\n • Symptomatic dermographism (see Fig. 11.2).\n • Vibratory angio-oedema.\n• Thermal:\n • Cold urticaria.\n • Localized heat urticaria.\n• Other:\n • Aquagenic urticaria.\n • Solar urticaria.\n • Exercise-induced anaphylaxis.\n2. Cholinergic urticaria\nMediated by acetylcholine liberated from sympathetic nerves. Stimuli\nthat increase the core temperature, such as anxiety, exertion, hot\nbaths, or sexual activity, precipitate a transient itching, stinging erythematous rash within 15min. Each small urticated papule is surrounded\nby a wide erythematous flare, and flares coalesce, resembling a flush.\nThe rash can usually be provoked by asking the patient to exercise hard\nenough to induce sweating. Urticaria is caused by the release of acetylcholine from sympathetic nerves in the skin.\n3. Contact urticaria\nContact with allergens or chemicals, e.g. latex.\nC. Other forms of urticaria\n1. Urticarial vasculitis\nLong-lasting wheals with bruising—vasculitis on skin biopsy. May be a\nsign of SLE (see E p. 443).\n2.

    "text": "Physical urticaria\nEach physical urticaria is induced reproducibly by the same physical stimulus and may coexist with ordinary urticaria. Consider challenge testing\nto prove the diagnosis, but testing is not without risk in severely affected\npatients who may develop systemic symptoms, including hypotension,\nwheezing, and anaphylaxis.\nSymptomatic dermographism\nDermographism is the commonest physical urticaria. An itchy wheal\ndevelops within 10min of rubbing the skin lightly and lasts about 1h.\nPatients may have normal-looking skin, and you will need to stroke the\nskin with a spatula to elicit dermographism (see Fig. 11.2).\nCold urticaria\nItchy wheals appear within minutes if the skin is exposed to cold. Angio\noedema and hypotension may complicate the picture and can be lifethreatening. Common triggers include cold winds and swimming in\ncold water.\n Diagnosis is confirmed by an ice cube test—an ice cube in a polythene\nbag (the skin must remain dry to exclude aquagenic urticaria) is held\nagainst the forearm skin for 20min. Wheals develop rapidly when the\nskin re-warms.\n Cold urticaria is occasionally associated with cryoglobulins, cold agglutinins, or cryofibrinogens (see E pp. 444–5). Familial cold urticaria is\none of the rare autosomal dominant hereditary fever syndromes caused\nby mutations in the NLRP3 gene (see E p. 236).\nDelayed pressure urticaria\nSustained pressure causes itchy or painful wheals after a delay of between\n30min and 6h. Swellings last up to 72h. Pressure urticaria may affect any\nsite, including the soles or palms (after carrying a heavy bag).\nSolar urticaria\nItchy wheals develop within 10min of exposure of the skin to UV or visible radiation. Solar urticaria occurs in erythropoietic protoporphyria\n(EPP), but this is a rare cause (see E p. 335).\nOther physical urticarias\nWater (aquagenic urticaria), heat (heat contact urticaria), or vibration\n(vibratory angio-oedema) trigger localized itchy urticarial reactions at\nthe site of application of the stimulus.\n Urticaria appears within 10min and resolves within 2h.",

    "text": "Management of urticaria\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nInvestigations\nInvestigations should be guided by the history and clinical findings (see\nBox 11.3). If the history does not suggest an underlying cause, it is unlikely\nthat investigations will be helpful in chronic urticaria.\nGeneral measures\n• Explain the disease and the difficulty in pinning down the cause.\n• Reassure the patient that urticaria can be controlled but that it\n may persist for some time. Fifty percent of patients with chronic\n spontaneous urticaria are clear within 6 months, but urticaria with\n angio-oedema may persist for years, as may physical urticarias.\n• Offer written information about urticaria (British Association of\n Dermatologists; see E Resources, p. 674).\n• Assess and monitor persistent disease (see Box 11.2).\n• Discuss how to minimize aggravating factors such as alcohol,\n overheating, pressure on the skin (tight clothes), or other physical\n triggers, if relevant. Warn patients with cold urticaria about the risk\n of immersion in cold water provoking anaphylaxis.\n• Advise dermographic patients to try not to scratch.\n• Minimize exposure to drugs that may exacerbate (see Box 11.4).\n• Prescribe a soothing antipruritic topical preparation such as oily\n calamine lotion or aqueous cream with 1% menthol.\nSpecific measures\n• Prescribe a non-sedating H1 antihistamine such as fexofenadine,\n cetirizine (works quickly but sedating in high doses), loratadine, or\n rupatadine. Patients may need to try several preparations before\n finding the optimal antihistamine and optimal dose. Forty percent of\n patients respond to antihistamines alone.\n• Suggest taking the antihistamine so that the drug level is highest\n before the urticaria usually erupts, e.g. in the evenings if urticaria is\n worst at night. The dose may need to be above the manufacturer’s\n recommended dose, provided potential benefits outweigh risks.\n• Reassure that prolonged treatment with antihistamines is safe.\n• Sedating H1 antihistamines, e.g. chlorphenamine 4–12mg,\n hydroxyzine 10–50mg, useful at night. Warn the patient about feeling\n drowsy in the morning. Avoid if driving, and caution in the elderly.\n• Adding an H2 antihistamine (ranitidine) or anti-leukotriene\n (montelukast 10mg) may be helpful.\n• Oral corticosteroids should generally be avoided but may shorten the\n duration of severe acute urticaria (prednisolone 20–30mg a day for\n 3 days in adults) and may be required in delayed pressure urticaria.\n• Topical corticosteroids are not recommended.\n• Cholinergic urticaria may improve with anticholinergics and\n anxiolytics, as well as antihistamines; use with caution in the elderly.\n• Systemic treatments used include ciclosporin methotrexate and",

    "text": "Erythema annulare centrifugum\n\nWhat is erythema annulare centrifugum?\nThis curious, but uncommon, condition is thought to be a ‘hypersensitivity reaction’ perhaps to drugs or infection, but, in most cases, a trigger is not identified. Small dermal blood vessels are cuffed by clusters\nof lymphocytes. Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is commoner in\nadults than children. Do not confuse this with the other erythemas (see\nBox 11.6).\nWhat should I look for?\n• A history of recurring red marks that slowly expand by 2–3mm a day\n into annular or arcuate shapes that clear centrally and then fade over\n days to weeks to leave normal skin.\n• The speed of evolution contrasts with the waves of rapidly\n expanding (1cm/day) erythematous concentric bands of erythema\n gyratum repens, a rare manifestation of internal malignancy\n (see E p. 546).\n• EAC tends to recur at the same site, i.e. trunk or proximal limbs.\n• A seasonal EAC that recurs annually has been described (see\n Fig. 11.3).\n• Sometimes patients complain the rash is itchy.\n• One or more erythematous macules, papules, well-defined annular\n (ring-shaped) lesions or arcuate shapes. Lesions reach a maximum of\n 10cm in diameter.\n• The trailing inner edge of the erythematous rings may be finely scaly\n in superficial EAC. Tinea corporis (‘ringworm’) is more scaly, and the\n scale is on the outer margin of the ring, rather than the inner edge.\n• Sometimes EAC is oedematous and vesicular.\nWhat should I do?\n• Look for possible triggers—drugs, infections.\n• Take a skin scrape for mycological culture to exclude fungal infection.\n• Consider taking a skin biopsy if the diagnosis is in doubt.\n• In widespread annular erythematous rashes, check the ANA and\n extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) to exclude subacute cutaneous LE\n (SCLE) (see E p. 402).\n• Explain that you are unlikely to be able to find the cause of the rash—\n ‘another of life’s great mysteries’—but that it will not do the patient\n any harm.

    "text": "Acne: presentation\nAcne is a disfiguring disorder of the pilosebaceous unit, usually starting\nbetween the ages of 12 and 14, that is experienced to some extent by\nalmost all teenagers. Acne may persist into adult life, and we seem to\nbe seeing more acne in older women. Pathogenesis is multifactorial (see\nBox 12.1).\nWhat should I ask?\n• When did the acne start? How bad is it today?\n• What impact is the acne having on the patient’s life? (see E p. 32.)\n Acne may have a major psychosocial impact, eroding self-confidence\n and causing depression or even suicide.\n• What treatment has the patient used and for how long? Most acne\n treatments take up to 4 months to have a maximal effect.\n• How are topical preparations, such as benzoyl peroxide or topical\n retinoids, being applied—all over the face or trunk (as they should be)\n or just on ‘spots’? Any adverse effects such as irritation of the skin?\n• Oral antibiotics—most patients will need prolonged treatment for\n several years. What does the patient mean by ‘taking a course’?\n• What else is being applied to the skin—greasy cosmetics or pomades?\n• What is the patient’s occupation? Is he or she in a hot or humid\n environment, working with tars or oils, or wearing a cap that\n occludes the forehead?\n• Is trauma irritating hair follicles (acne mechanica)—friction under chin\n straps, helmets, or shoulder pads (American footballers), or repeated\n rubbing of the face with exfoliative creams?\n• Is the patient taking drugs that might exacerbate acne? (see E Drugs\n and skin diseases, p. 384 and 388.)\n• Refractory severe acne (see Box 12.4).\nWhat should I look for?\n(See Figs. 12.1 and 12.2.)\n• Acne affects the face and/or upper trunk. If acne is in an unusual or\n asymmetrical distribution, could this be related to an external factor?\n• More than one type of lesion: pustules, papules, comedones\n (blackhead = open comedone; whitehead = closed comedone),\n nodules, cysts, and scars (deep ‘ice-pick’ or flat).\n• Record the types of lesions that are present, so you can monitor the\n outcome of treatment.\n• Do comedones predominate? Suggests exposure to tar or\n chlorinated hydrocarbons. Could this be pomade acne on the\n forehead?\n• Signs of virilization such as hirsutism. Check for cliteromegaly if you\n suspect virilization (see E pp. 474–7).\n• HAIR-AN syndrome (see E p. 476).\n• Even mild acne may cause acne keloids or, in dark skin, long-lasting\n hyperpigmentation. Prolonged courses of minocycline may cause\n hyperpigmentation in scars.\n S B 12 2 f l l",

    "text": "Box 12.1 Pathogenesis of acne\n The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but a number of factors play\n a part in triggering chronic inflammation around pilosebaceous units:\n • Sebum excretion is increased (but may remain high when acne has\n cleared).\n • Androgens stimulate sebum secretion by the sebaceous glands.\n • Occlusion of follicular ducts by hyperkeratinization (may be\n exacerbated by application of some greasy topical preparations\n or tar).\n • Bacterial colonization of follicular ducts by Propionibacterium acnes,\n a skin commensal. P. acnes breaks down triglycerides, releasing\n free fatty acids that trigger dermal inflammation. P. acnes may\n also activate Toll-like receptors on keratinocytes which induce\n inflammation.\n • Increased fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) signalling\n (mutations in FGFR2 leading to increased signalling cause acne in\n Apert syndrome; see Box 12.4). Androgens upregulate signalling.\n • Genes: about 50% of patients have a family history of acne.\n • Diet: a link between acne and dairy products has been suggested\n but needs more study.\n\nBox 12.2 Variants of acne\n • Acne ‘excoriée de la jeune fille’: young girls with mild acne, but\n obsessional picking scars the skin. Difficult to manage. Even mild\n disease may need systemic treatment (see E p. 566).\n • Neonatal and infantile acne: usually face. May persist until age 3 or\n 4. Consider inhaled corticosteroids as a cause (see E p. 244).\n • Acne conglobata: severe acne with grouped comedones, deep\n nodules, and abscesses with sinuses oozing pus (see E p. 250).\n • Acne fulminans: nodulocystic acne, fever, and joint pains\n (see E p. 248).\n • Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO)\n syndrome (see E p. 248).\n • PAPA syndrome: rare AD auto-inflammatory disease\n (see E pp. 234–5 and pp. 248–9).\n • PASH syndrome: rare auto-inflammatory syndrome (pyoderma\n gangrenosum, acne, hidradenitis suppurativa).\n • Comedo-like acneiform lesions (chloracne) associated with\n exposure to dioxin.\n\nFurther reading\nBhate K and Williams H.

    "text": "Acne vulgaris: management\n\nWhat should I do?\n• Provide written information about acne—reassure that the skin is not\n dirty and that you can help.\n• Explain that all treatments take 3–4 months to have a maximal effect\n and that acne may get a little worse before it gets better. Treatment\n may have to be continued for months or even years.\n• If acne is not responding to treatment (and the patient is following\n your advice), have you made the right diagnosis? Is there an\n underlying systemic disease? (See Boxes 12.3 and 12.4.)\nMild acne\nStart one or more topical preparations (combination more effective than\nmonotherapy). Explain treatment should be applied to all the skin, not\njust ‘spots’. Continue treatment for at least 4 months and usually longer.\nTopical preparations (cream, gel, or lotion) may include:\n• Antibiotics, e.g. erythromycin or clindamycin lotion.\n• Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% (as effective and less irritant than higher\n percentage, bleaches clothing; can combine with a topical retinoid).\n• Topical retinoid (avoid in pregnancy), e.g. tretinoin, isotretinoin, or\n 0.1% adapalene (a retinoid-like drug). All are irritants and may cause\n post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in dark skin. Increase contact\n time gradually, washing off after 30–60min at first.\nModerate acne\n• Oral antibiotics for a 4-month course initially, e.g. oxytetracycline\n 500mg bd, lymecycline 408mg/day, or erythromycin 500mg bd,\n combined with topical benzoyl peroxide to reduce the incidence of\n bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Do not combine with a topical\n antibiotic. Avoid tetracyclines in children aged <12 years.\n• ♀: oral contraceptive with anti-androgen activity such as cocyprindiol (takes 6 months to have maximal effect). Avoid\n contraceptive pills containing norethisterone (androgenic properties).\nSevere acne or acne with a major psychosocial impact\n(See Fig. 12.2.)\n• Refer to a specialist. The oral retinoid isotretinoin may be the\n best option (0.5–1.0mg/kg/day; cumulative dose 120–150mg/kg).\n Isotretinoin is teratogenic. Other adverse effects include mucosal\n dryness and, very rarely, depression. Contraception essential in\n women of childbearing age during treatment and for 1 month after\n stopping isotretinoin (see E Chapter 34, p. 669).\n• Cysts: intralesional triamcinolone (0.1mL of 2.5–10mg/mL solution).\nScars\n• Shallow scars become less obvious with time. Refer for cosmetic\n camouflage (see Changing Faces, available at: M https://www.\n changingfaces.org.uk/Home).\n• Surgical approaches (chemical peels, lasers, dermabrasion) may",

    "text": "Acne with arthritis\n• Acne fulminans\nThis emergency affects adolescent boys who have previously had mild\nto moderate acne (see Boxes 12.5 and 12.6). Haemorrhagic, crusted,\nulcerative skin lesions erupt on the back, chest, arms, and face. Systemic\nsymptoms include fever, malaise, weight loss, myalgia, and arthralgia.\nPatients may have hepatosplenomegaly or erythema nodosum.\n Radiographs show lytic bone lesions, most often affecting the sternum\nand clavicle, but osteolytic lesions have been seen in the hips, ankles,\nand humerus. Osteolytic lesions are sterile. Sternoclavicular hyperostosis and sacroiliitis have also been described. Periosteal formation of\nnew bone, sclerosis, and thickening occur late. Bony changes are transient, and the prognosis is good. Findings may be consistent with SAPHO\nsyndrome.\nAcne conglobata\nSeronegative spondyloarthropathy and SAPHO syndrome have also\nbeen described in patients with acne conglobata (see E p. 250).\nWhat is SAPHO syndrome?\nSAPHO syndrome, an auto-inflammatory bone disease, may account for\n4% of all patients with seronegative spondyloarthropathies. Inflammatory\nbowel disease is associated with SAPHO.\n The syndrome is characterized by:\n• Intermittent predominantly axial Synovitis (sternum, clavicles, ribs,\n spine, pelvis).\n• Aseptic Osteitis and Hyperostosis. Bony pain is common.\n• CT scans show lytic bone lesions—these are sterile.\n• Chronic (or relapsing) sterile pustular Acneiform eruptions or\n palmoplantar Pustulosis (for other skin diseases, see Box 12.7).\n• Leucocytosis and anaemia.\nTreatment is unsatisfactory. Tetracycline antibiotics or isotretinoin may\ncontrol acne. Topical steroids and acitretin may control palmoplantar\npustulosis. NSAIDs, prednisolone, and methotrexate have been used for\nsynovitis.

    "text": "Rosacea\nRosacea is common in the third and fourth decades. Pathogenesis is\nuncertain, but genetic factors play a part. Rosacea has a particularly high\nprevalence in Ireland (Celts with fair skin).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Patients will often have had a long-standing tendency to flush or blush\n easily, now the face is permanently red (also see E p. 520).\n• What makes the redness worse? The skin is easily irritated by topical\n products. Alcohol, spicy foods, sudden temperature change, and hot\n drinks can all precipitate reddening. Sunlight may also exacerbate\n rosacea. The role of demodex is uncertain (see E p. 178).\n• What does the patient notice? Crops of red bumps (papules), ‘yellowheads’ (pustules)? Is the skin rough or scaly? (Scale is seen more\n often in seborrhoeic dermatitis than rosacea, but the conditions may\n overlap; see Fig. 12.3).\n• What medicaments is the patient using and for how long? Topical\n corticosteroids can cause a rosacea-like rash (perioral dermatitis; see\n E p. 256). Oral corticosteroids cause a pustular rash and redness.\n Peripheral vasodilators may exacerbate redness (see E p. 389).\n• Patients may have noticed enlargement of the nose.\n• Eye symptoms are common, e.g. burning, itching, redness, grittiness.\nWhat should I look for?\n(See Fig. 12.3.)\n Signs vary. Rosacea may be predominantly erythematotelangiectatic\n(red), papulopustular, phymatous, or granulomatous. Look for:\n• A rash affecting the central face, usually in a symmetrical pattern, but,\n on occasion, rosacea can be strikingly asymmetrical.\n• Erythema and telangiectasia (see Fig. 12.3).\n• Dome-shaped erythematous papules and pustules without comedones\n (see Fig. 12.3). Comedones suggest acne (see E pp. 242–3), not\n rosacea.

    "text": "Perioral dermatitis\n(periorificial dermatitis)\nPerioral dermatitis is an inflammatory condition that occurs in children and adults, usually young and middle-aged women. The cause is\nunknown, but exogenous factors, such as potent topical corticosteroids\n(see E p. 657), inhaled corticosteroids, irritant cosmetics, fluorinated\ntoothpastes, and occlusive emollients, have been implicated.\n The name is misleading. Perioral skin is affected more often than other\nsites, but the condition may affect periocular and perinasal skin. It has\nalso been reported on the trunk. Nor is perioral dermatitis a typical\ndermatitis; it is more akin to rosacea. Dermatitis is treated with a topical corticosteroid; yet topical corticosteroids are one of the causes of\nperioral dermatitis.\nWhat should I look for?\n• A history of a rash that burns, rather than itches.\n• Explore what has been applied to the skin. Many (but not all) patients\n with perioral dermatitis will have been applying a potent topical\n corticosteroid to their face prior to the onset of the rash. The\n corticosteroid relieves burning and causes transient vasoconstriction,\n which reduces redness, so the patient continues to apply the cream in\n the mistaken belief that the corticosteroid is helping.\n• Clusters of tiny (<2mm in diameter) erythematous papules and\n vesicopustules (the tiny vesicles rapidly evolve into pustules) around\n the mouth (see Fig. 12.7).\n• The background skin is erythematous and may be scaly.\n• The rash tends to spare the vermillion border of the lips.\n• Periocular (usually below the eye) and perinasal lesions are probably\n commoner in children than adults.\nWhat should I do?\n• Try to identify the underlying cause—most often applications of a\n potent topical corticosteroid to the face—and advise avoidance of\n any potential skin irritant.\n• Convince the patient that the topical corticosteroid (or other\n preparation) is the cause of the problem—this may be difficult.\n (Try to avoid blaming the doctor who prescribed the strong\n corticosteroid—it is quite possible that the patient has not followed\n the doctor’s instructions or has obtained the corticosteroid from a\n well-meaning friend or relation.)\n• Warn the patient that the skin is going to look worse, before it\n gets better, and to resist the temptation to restart the topical\n corticosteroid (the redness and irritation will be more obvious when\n the corticosteroid is withdrawn).\n• Prescribe topical or oral therapy (see Box 12.10).\n• Reassure the patient—the prognosis is good, and the rash generally\n clears in 8–12 weeks.",

    "text": "Adhesion in the epidermis\nIn order to understand the 1° bullous diseases, it will help to appreciate\nthe interactions between structural proteins that provide the mechanical\nscaffolding of the skin.\nAdhesion between keratinocytes\nThe main adhesion junctions between keratinocytes in the epidermis are\ndesmosomes. Desmosomes contain transmembrane adhesion proteins\n(desmosomal cadherins) and cytoplasmic plaque proteins. Interactions\nbetween the extracellular portions of the transmembrane cadherins\nhold the keratinocytes together. The cytoplasmic portion of the cadherin inserts into the desmosomal plaque where it interacts with plaque\nproteins such as desmoplakin or plakoglobin. These plaque proteins link\nto keratins in the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, which are linked to\nthe nucleus. Thus the whole network is stable, and signals can be transduced from the external surface of the cell through the desmosome to\nthe nucleus (see Fig. 13.2a).\nAdhesion between basal keratinocytes\nand the basement membrane\nHemidesmosomes at the base of basal keratinocytes attach keratinocytes to the basement membrane. Hemidesmosomes, like desmosomes,\ncontain transmembrane adhesion proteins and cytoplasmic plaque proteins. Transmembrane hemidesmosomal proteins, such as BP antigen\n2 BP180 (collagen XVII) and α6β4 integrin, extend into the basement\nmembrane zone (BMZ) to interact with proteins, such as laminins, in\nanchoring filaments to bind the epidermis to the basement membrane.\nThe cytoplasmic portions of these transmembrane hemidesmosomal\nproteins interact with cytoplasmic plaque proteins in the hemidesmosome such as plectin and BP antigen 1 (BP230). As in desmosomes, these\nplaque proteins link hemidesmosomes to the keratins of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, which are, in turn, connected to the nucleus\nof the cell (see Fig. 13.2b).\nThe basement membrane zone\nThe surface area of the basement membrane interface between the epidermis and dermis is increased and adhesion enhanced by downward\nprojections from the epidermis (epidermal rete pegs) that interdigitate\nwith upward projections from the dermis (dermal papillae). Interactions\nbetween laminins, collagens, and non-collagenous proteins in the BMZ\npromote adhesion. The lamina lucida (electron-lucent zone) of the basement membrane, containing laminins, lies immediately beneath basal\nkeratinocytes. Laminins attach to collagen IV in the underlying lamina\ndensa. Fine anchoring filaments (laminin-332, laminin-311) bound to\nextracellular domains of the hemidesmosomal protein α6β4 integrin\nextend across the lamina lucida into the lamina densa where the filaments link to anchoring fibrils (collagen VII). The anchoring fibrils fasten\nthe lamina densa to the underlying collagen bundles of the papillary deri ( Fi 13 2b)",

The blister may contain a few\n neutrophils and some acantholytic keratinocytes.\n • Direct and indirect IMF microscopy—IgG and C3 between\n keratinocytes.\n\n Box 13.4 Rare variants of pemphigus\n • Drug-induced pemphigus: sulfhydryl drugs, such as captopril,\n enalapril, and penicillamine, may trigger pemphigus, most often\n pemphigus foliaceus.\n • Endemic or Brazilian pemphigus foliaceus (fogo selvagem = ‘wild fire’\n in Portuguese): clustered in certain states in Brazil and possibly\n precipitated by an environmental factor, e.g. a biting insect (the\n black fly has been postulated to be a vector).\n • Paraneoplastic pemphigus: associated with B-cell lymphoma,\n thymoma, and Castleman disease (a rare lymphoproliferative\n disorder) (see E p. 538). Some cases have been linked to\n treatment with fludarabine (see E p. 386).\n • IgA pemphigus (very rare!): with features that overlap those of\n subcorneal pustular dermatosis (Sneddon–Wilkinson disease).\n\nFurther reading\nHarman KE et al Br J Dermatol 2003;149:926 37 A ailable at: M htt :// bad or k/",

    "text": "Lichen sclerosus\nThis chronic inflammatory disease with a predilection for genital skin\nhas two peaks of onset—childhood and post-menopausal. The cause is\nuncertain, but a lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune pathogenesis is suspected. Lichen sclerosus may occur in association with morphoea (see\nE pp. 420–1) (with which extragenital lichen sclerosus shows considerable clinical and histological overlap), LP, and vitiligo.\n Lichen sclerosus is commonest in adult ♀. It may be asymptomatic\nbut usually presents with itch, pain, and/or dyspareunia. Perianal involvement with painful anal fissures may lead to constipation in young girls.\nUncircumcised ♂ are affected. Lichen sclerosus of the foreskin (balanitis\nzerotica obliterans) is a major indication for circumcision. Lichen sclerosus may also develop around stomas, most often urostomies.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Pearly white papules and plaques on labia minora, clitoris, and\n interlabial sulci (see Fig. 14.2).\n• Sparing of the vulvar vestibule (unlike LP).\n• Signs may extend in a figure-of-eight configuration to perianal skin in\n ♀ (perianal skin is not affected in ♂).\n• Atrophy gives the skin a shiny crinkled appearance (see Fig. 14.2).\n• Discrete areas of haemorrhage (ecchymoses) within the white\n plaques (may be misdiagnosed as sexual abuse in young girls) (see\n Fig. 14.2).\n• Loss of normal anatomy in chronic disease—resorption of the labia\n minora, fusion of the labia, and burying of the clitoris.\n• Uncircumcised ♂—thickening and tightening of the foreskin, causing\n phimosis. White plaques on the glans penis, sometimes with scarring.\n Sometimes pearly white papules on the shaft of the penis.\n• Extragenital lichen sclerosus is uncommon—the hypopigmented\n crinkled plaques contain follicular plugs (unlike morphoea; see\n E pp. 420–1), ecchymoses, and rarely haemorrhagic blisters.\n Hypopigmented papules are sometimes seen in children.\n• 0 SCC is a rare complication in chronic genital disease in adults\n (around 5% of patients). Often presents with pain. Check for mucosal\n thickening, a nodule, or a persistent ulcer (see E p. 350).\nWhat should I do?\n• Take a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n• Recommend a soap substitute for genital use, e.g. Cetraben® cream.\n• A very potent topical corticosteroid (0.05% clobetasol propionate\n ointment), applied x1/day for 4 weeks and then with gradually\n decreasing frequency for a further 8 weeks, usually controls disease\n and may even reverse the early changes (may also be effective in\n children).\n• Counsel about the small risk of SCC; teach self-examination, and\n recommend annual reviews.",

One to 2% of people will\ndevelop a leg ulcer during their life, and chronic ulcers cause morbidity\nand disability, particularly in older people.\n Traditionally, nurses care for leg ulcers, and doctors are asked to\nsee the patient when complications ensue or the ulcer is not healing as\nexpected. Many doctors feel poorly trained to deal with such patients,\nparticularly because they have no experience of what is a ‘normal’\nleg ulcer.\n Learn from the expertise of the wound care nurses, and take an interest in patients’ leg ulcers.

    "text": "Preparing to examine the ulcer\nThe leg ulcer is likely to be hidden away under dressings and bandages.\nMany doctors are reluctant to remove bandages, perhaps for fear of what\nthey might find underneath, but more often because they are pressed for\ntime or feel ill-prepared to re-dress the leg, a task that may not be as\neasy as it sounds without the help of a skilled nurse. But it is important to\ninspect the limb beneath the bandages—try not to be put off.\n Explain to the patient what you wish to do and why. Ask if any preparation is required, before the dressing is removed. Is analgesia required?\n Try to find out what dressings or bandages are being used.\n Discuss your plans with the nurses; arrange a suitable time; help the\nnurses to set up a dressing trolley … , and take the plunge.\nWhat do I need?\n• Plastic gloves (do not need to be sterile) and a plastic apron.\n• A trolley with:\n • Gauze swabs, scissors, plastic forceps, and a sinus probe (if the\n ulcer might be deeply penetrating).\n • A bag for disposing of contaminated dressings.\n• Water for washing the leg and the ulcer—a bucket may be useful.\n• Cling film to cover the ulcer—exposing the ulcer to air may be\n painful.\n• A sphygmomanometer, stethoscope, and Doppler ultrasound probe\n for checking the ABPI (see Box 15.6).\n• A tendon hammer, tuning fork (128Hz), and disposable neurological\n pin if you suspect a neuropathic ulcer. (Ideally a Semmes–Weinstein\n 10g monofilament for evaluation of sensation if you know how to\n use it.)\n• A tape measure.\n• An acetate sheet (or the transparent cover of a dressing pack) and a\n pen for tracing the ulcer.\n• A digital camera.\n• Liquid paraffin 50% in WSP or a bland ointment, such as Hydromol®,\n to moisturize the skin.\n• Dressings and bandages (see E p. 306), including a viscose\n stockinette bandage, long enough to run from the toe to just below\n the knee to hold the dressing in place.\n• Surgical adhesive tape for securing the end of the bandage—avoid\n safety pins.",

Are the legs oedematous, or is there lymphoedema?\n (see E pp. 316–17.)\n• Check the blood pressure (see Box 15.3).\n• Remove bandages to expose the leg. Gently peel off dressings, so that\n the ulcer is exposed. You may need to soak the dressing with normal\n saline prior to removal if it has stuck to the wound.\n• Note the colour and quantity of the exudate on the dressing. Heavy\n exudate suggests heavy bacterial colonization. Green dressings\n indicate the presence of Pseudomonas.\n• Remove loose crust, scab, or adherent dressing, and gently wash the\n ulcer with water, so you can see the base and wound edges.\n• If the ulcer is painful when exposed to air, cover temporarily with\n cling film or a moist gauze swab.\n• Assess the ulcer—site, wound edge, and wound bed (slough,\n granulation tissue, necrotic base) (see Box 15.4).\n• Measure the ulcer (maximum diameters or trace onto an acetate\n sheet).\n• Probe to assess the amount of undermining and depth of the ulcer.\n• Record the appearance of the ulcer with photographs, if possible.\n• Examine the surrounding skin, looking for signs that may be linked to\n the cause of the ulcer (see Boxes 15.3 and 15.4).\n• Look for cellulitis—heat, swelling, tender erythema (this may be\n difficult to differentiate from lipodermatosclerosis (see E p. 308).\n• Assess the peripheral circulation, including the ABPI (see Box 15.6).\n• Assess joint mobility at ankles and feet, and look for joint deformity.\n\n Box 15.3 Hypertensive ulcer (Martorell ulcer)\n • The existence of this entity is controversial, and these ulcers must\n be rare.\n • Painful ulceration may be 2° to a thrombo-occlusive vasculopathy of\n cutaneous arterioles in long-standing hypertension.\n • Patients present with an extremely painful superficial ulcer with an\n erythematous or purpuric rim, usually on the anterolateral aspect\n of the shin.

Ensure the patient is comfortable in that position.\n• Apply a sphygmomanometer cuff to the arm.\n• Inflate the cuff, while feeling the radial pulse to get a rough idea of\n the systolic pressure.\n• Apply ultrasound gel to the skin over the brachial pulse.\n• Angle the Doppler probe at 45–60°, and find the brachial pulse (adjust\n the position and angle of the probe, until the sound is maximal).\n• Inflate the cuff, until the sound disappears.\n• Slowly release the pressure, and record the pressure at which the\n sound of the brachial pulse reappears.\n• Repeat in the other arm, and take the higher of the two readings.\n• Place cling film around the leg, covering the surface of the ulcer.\n• Place the cuff around the leg just above the medial malleolus.\n• Palpate the dorsalis pedis pulse between the first and second\n metatarsals. Apply ultrasound gel to the skin over the pulse, and\n find the dorsalis pedis pulse using the probe. Angle the probe at\n 45–60° to the foot.\n• Inflate the cuff, until the sound disappears; deflate slowly, and\n record the pressure at which the sound reappears.\n• If possible, repeat at the posterior tibial pulse, and take the higher\n of the two readings—but some patients do find the tight cuff\n uncomfortable.\n• Repeat in the other leg.\n• Calculate the ABPI in each leg: ABPI = highest ankle pressure/\n highest brachial pressure.\n\nBox 15.6 Interpretation of the ABPI\n• ABPI: 0.9–1.0 = safe to apply high compression.\n• ABPI: 0.8 = excludes significant arterial disease.

    "text": "Pain and leg ulcers\nSevere pain is common in patients with arterial ulcers, but do not underestimate the pain suffered by patients with venous ulcers. The pathogenesis of pain is complex. Local dehydration caused by dressings, cutaneous\nischaemia, and bacterial infection may play a part. Chronic pain demoralizes patients, limiting physical activity, but older patients may be reluctant\nto report pain (see Box 15.8).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Where is the pain? Ask the patient to point. Ensure the pain is caused\n by the ulcer—arthritis of the back, hip, or knee may cause leg pain.\n• What is the pain like? (See Box 15.8.)\n• How bad is the pain? Obtain a measure of the overall intensity of\n the pain by asking the patient to grade the pain (mild, moderate, or\n severe) or rate the pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe).\n• When did the pain start, and how long does the pain last?\n• Has the pain changed? Worsening may indicate ischaemia or cellulitis.\n• What causes the pain? Typically, arterial ulcers cause severe pain\n at night, but many patients with venous ulcers also have pain that\n interferes with sleeping. Standing and walking cause pain in venous, as\n well as arterial, ulcers. Dressing changes may be very painful.\n• What relieves the pain—elevation? Compression?\n• What is the impact of the pain? Is the patient depressed or socially isolated?\n• What analgesia is being taken and how often?\nWhat should I do?\n• Ensure the skin is not inflamed and there is no evidence of infection.\n• Review dressings. Most ‘non’-adherent dressings are drying, adhere\n to wounds (despite the name), and cause pain; hydrogels and\n hydrocolloids relieve pain.\n• Review the dressing technique—use warm water for washing the\n ulcer; leave the ulcer uncovered for the minimum amount of time.\n• Ensure that bandages are not compromising the vascular supply.\n Check with a pulse oximeter, if any doubt (see E p. 300).\n• Prescribe analgesia to be taken prior to dressing changes.\n• A bed-cradle may help to relieve night pain, as may elevating the head\n of the bed by 12–15cm in patients with arterial disease.\n• Elevation and compression bandages may alleviate much of the pain\n associated with venous ulcers, but not all patients tolerate this treatment,\n and some have neuropathic pain that does not respond to compression.\n• Advise patients to avoid standing for prolonged periods.\n• Refer for a vascular opinion if the Doppler ABPI is reduced to below 0.8.\n• Prescribe analgesics, according to a pain ladder (see E pp. 304–5).\n• Reassure the patient that analgesia taken for pain is rarely addictive,\n and ensure the patient understands the importance of taking\n analgesia regularly to prevent the onset of pain.\nPain ladder\nNociceptive pain",

    "text": "Box 15.8 Descriptors from the short-form McGill Pain\n Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)\n Pain is a complex sensation difficult to describe. Physical, psychological,\n and social factors influence the perception of pain. Patients may have\n a mix of nociceptive and neuropathic pain. SF-MPQ has 15 descriptors\n (11 sensory; 4 affective). Patients rate the intensity of each descriptor.\n Nociceptive pain associated with venous and arterial ulcers is usually\n throbbing or aching. Shooting, stabbing, or sharp pain suggests a neuropathic component. Burning may indicate damage to the skin.\n • Sensory descriptors: throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping,\n gnawing, hot/burning, aching, heavy, tender, splitting.\n • Affective descriptors: tiring/exhausting, sickening, fearful, punishing/\n cruel.\n\n Reproduced with permission from Melzack R, The short-form McGill pain questionnaire,\n Pain, 30:2, 1987, Elsevier.\n\nModerate pain\n• Try increasing strengths of codeine with paracetamol.\n• Co-codamol weak (8mg of codeine phosphate plus 500mg of\n paracetamol) 1–2 tablets 4-hourly (max. = 8 tablets/day).\n• Co-codamol medium (15mg of codeine phosphate plus 500mg of\n paracetamol) 1–2 tablets 4-hourly (max. = 8 tablets/day).\n• Co-codamol strong (30mg of codeine phosphate plus 500mg of\n paracetamol) 1–2 tablets 4-hourly (max. = 8 tablets/day).\n• If not controlled, try dihydrocodeine, 30mg every 4–6h (max. =\n 240mg/day). Stimulant laxatives may be required with these drugs.\nSevere pain\n• Day pain: short-acting morphine, 10mg 4-hourly (5mg in the elderly),\n and increase the dose by 50% incrementally.\n• Night pain: twice 4-hourly dose, i.e. 10 or 20mg nocte. Incident or\n breakthrough pain 5–10mg of morphine PRN, i.e. the 4-hourly dose.\n• An antiemetic may be used in conjunction with these initially, but, if\n still nauseated after 3 days, the dose should be reduced.\n• Once pain control is stable, change from short-acting morphine to\n slow-release. Divide the total dose into two portions for 12-hourly\n administration. Ensure that the patient has an ‘escape’ dose of shortacting morphine for breakthrough pain. The escape dose should be\n 1/6 of the daily morphine dose in mg.\n• Avoid NSAIDs in older patients (often used with paracetamol). Adverse\neffects include GI bleeding, duodenal or gastric ulceration, and renal failure.\nNeuropathic pain\nDifficult to alleviate. Antidepressants, e.g. amitriptyline 25–50mg/day,\nmay help. Increase the dose gradually. Anti-epileptic drugs, e.g. gabapentin, are also effective in some cases.",

    "text": "Management of ulcers\n\nGeneral advice\nCorrect factors such as oedema, iron or vitamin C deficiency, and pain\n(see E p. 304). Wash ulcers and surrounding skin with tap water. Pick\noff loose scale, and moisturize the skin with 50% WSP in liquid paraffin or Hydromol® ointment. (Ointments are less likely to sensitize than\ncreams.) Clean and dry the skin between the toes, and trim or file nails\n(a chiropodist may help).\nWound care\nReduce bacterial contamination with antiseptic soaks or wet dressings\n(see E p. 662). Moist wounds heal more quickly than those exposed to\nair, but too much moisture irritates the skin and macerates wound edges\nwhich become friable and break down. Protect the edges with zinc oxide\npaste or Cavilon® (expensive).\n Choice of dressing depends on the type and state of the ulcer (see\nBox 15.9).\nVenous ulcers\n• Graduated compression bandaging promotes healing. Bandages\n should extend from the base of toes to below the knee. Experts\n apply bandages with an even tension, so that the pressure steadily\n reduces from the ankle to the calf (see Box 15.10). • Check the ABPI\n before compressing the limb (see Box 15.6).\n• Avoid prolonged standing (stand on tiptoes at intervals to activate the\n leg muscle pump) or sitting with the feet dependent (elevate the legs\n with the feet at heart level, and dorsiflex the feet regularly to activate\n the muscle pump).\n• Encourage mobility and weight loss.\n• Aspirin and pentoxifylline have been advocated to promote healing of\n venous ulcers, but their role is unproven.\n• Skin grafts (pinch, punch, or split-thickness) may hasten reepithelialization of ulcers with granulating bases, once oedema is\n controlled. Refer to a vascular service if the ulcer is not healing. Also\n refer patients with healed venous ulcers to a vascular service. Vascular\n surgery to correct venous hypertension may prevent recurrence.\n• Once the ulcer has healed, ensure that the patient has compression\n hosiery (ideally class II). The patient may need help to put on stockings.\nArterial ulcers\n• Keep the limb warm. Advise patients to stop smoking and control\n other risk factors for arterial disease such as hypertension or diabetes.\n• Encourage regular graded exercise to promote circulation.\n• Protect bony prominences and pressure areas (heels) with padding.\n• Vascular surgeons may be able to improve the blood supply with\n balloon angioplasty or a femoropopliteal bypass graft.\n• Skin grafting may have a role, once underlying vascular problems have\n been corrected.

    "text": "Pyoderma gangrenosum\n0 Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by acutely painful, rapidly enlarging deep ulcers (see Box 15.11). PG is\nneither an infection nor gangrenous, but is probably an aberrant immune\nresponse. Clearance of inflammatory cells may be impaired by abnormalities in, for example, neutrophil chemokines, integrins, or T-cells.\n Ulcers can occur at any site, including the genitalia, but PG usually\npresents on the leg. It is seen most often in middle-aged adults but can\naffect any age. About 50% of patients have an underlying disease (see\nBox 15.12). Rarely, PG is triggered by surgery, often breast surgery.\nDiagnosis is clinical and may be difficult (see Box 15.12).\nWhat should I ask?\n(see E pp. 294–5.)\n• How did the ulcer start? (Was minor trauma involved?)\n• Is the ulcer painful? How quickly is it enlarging?\n• Has the patient another reason to have a leg ulcer (venous disease,\n arterial disease, infection), a past history of PG, or a systemic disease\n that might predispose to PG? (See Box 15.11.)\nWhat should I do?\n• Look for signs suggesting PG (see Box 15.12 and Fig. 15.5).\n• Rule out common causes of ulceration, but venous or arterial disease\n may coexist with PG (see Box 15.12).\n• FBC, ESR, CRP, protein electrophoresis, and Ig (20% have a benign\n monoclonal gammopathy), RF, antiphospholipid antibodies.\n• Take a biopsy from the ulcer edge for histology (may be suggestive\n but is not diagnostic); culture (bacteria, fungi such as sporotrichosis)\n (see E Box 33.2, p. 645).\n• Prescribe analgesia.\n• Dressings, such as hydrocolloids or alginates, may relieve pain.\n• Try gentle compression to control oedema (if tolerated).\n• Pustules, bullae, or small ulcers—a very potent topical\n corticosteroid ointment or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment may control\n pain, inflammation, and ulceration, but watch for 2° infection, e.g.\n Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n• 3 Large ulcers—prompt treatment with prednisolone 40–60mg/day\n or pulse IV methylprednisolone is essential to minimize scarring.\n Steroid-sparing agents that may be tried include minocycline,\n ciclosporin, and dapsone.\n• Anti-TNF agents may be effective, particularly in PG with IBD or RA.\n• • Avoid surgery in active disease, as trauma will exacerbate\n ulceration. Skin grafting may be considered for large ulcers, but only\n when inflammation is controlled.\nFurther reading\nPatel F et al. Acta Derm Venereol 2015;95:525–31.",

    "text": "Introduction\nLife on earth depends on the sun’s warmth and light. Our spirits rise in\nthe sun, and sunny days evoke memories of long holidays (as well as revision for exams). But the sun has the potential to harm—there can be ‘too\nmuch of a good thing’. Sunburn, skin cancer, and most photosensitivity\ndisorders are caused by UVR.\nHow does ultraviolet radiation affect the skin?\nThe sun emits a broad and continuous spectrum of electromagnetic\nenergy (the solar spectrum) (see Fig. 16.1). UVR is divided into short\n(UVC), medium (UVB), and long (UVA, ‘black light’) wavelength emissions. Ninety-eight percent of the UVR that reaches the earth’s surface\nis UVA. All UVC and a little UVB are absorbed in the atmosphere by the\nozone layer. UVB is absorbed by nucleic acids and proteins in the epidermis and stimulates the synthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Some\nUVA is absorbed in the epidermis, but UVA penetrates into the dermis.\n The damage caused by UVR depends on the duration of exposure, as\nwell as the skin phototype (see Table 16.1).\n• UVB causes immediate sunburn with painful erythema and, if\n severe, blistering. The UVB reaction peaks at 16–24h, then the skin\n desquamates over 2–3 days but becomes tanned and may develop\n solar lentigines (sunburn freckles).\n• UVR, particularly UVB, damages DNA, and cumulative damage\n causes skin cancer (see E p. 346).\n• Chronic UV exposure produces many of the signs we associate\n with ageing (photodamage)—wrinkling, blotchy pigmentation,\n telangiectasia, a sallow appearance—as well as skin cancer (see\n E Box 3.1, p. 43).\n• UVR also causes local and systemic immunosuppression, which not\n only leads to problems, such as recurrent herpes simplex infection,\n but also contributes to the pathogenesis of skin cancer.\nHow is the skin protected from sun damage?\nNucleotide excision repair enzymes repair photodamaged DNA, but the\ncapacity to repair declines with age (or may be abnormal in some rare\nphotogenodermatoses; see E pp. 336–7). Epidermal melanin provides\nsome UV protection by absorbing visible light, as well as UVR (see E\npp. 12–3). Melanin also quenches oxygen free radicals.\n Darkly pigmented skin has the same number of melanocytes as lightly\npigmented skin, but more and slightly differently packaged melanin\n(melanosomes) within keratinocytes provides greater resistance to solar\ndamage. However, even dark skin burns in the sun, if the dose of UVR\nis high enough.\n UVA causes immediate darkening of the skin (oxidation of pre-existing\nmelanin) that lasts a few hours and is not photoprotective. UVB is the\nmain stimulus for the delayed tanning detectable 3–5 days after exposure\n(more melanocytes, synthesis of new melanin, redistribution of melanosomes). This provides some photoprotection and fades slowly.",

Other potential presentations of a drug-induced photosensitivity include pseudoporphyria (see E p. 334) and LE (see E p. 402).\nWhat is phototoxicity?\nPhototoxicity causes an exaggerated sunburn response with pain, erythema, oedema, and sometimes blistering of exposed skin. The action\nspectrum for phototoxins may be UVB, UVA, or visible solar radiation.\nThe response depends on the amount of UVR (the patient may have no\nproblems on a slightly cloudy day) and the dose of the drug but can occur\non first exposure to the drug. The response is usually immediate but can\nbe delayed. Reactions to amiodarone and chlorpromazine produce pigmentary changes. Chronic phototoxicity accelerates photoageing, e.g.\npatients taking voriconazole for antifungal prophylaxis. Examine the skin\nregularly.\n Phytophotodermatitis is a phototoxic eruption caused by contact with\nplant juices containing light-sensitizing furocoumarin chemicals, e.g. psoralens (see Box 16.4).\nWhat is photoallergy?\nPhotoallergic reactions are idiosyncratic delayed hypersensitivity reactions, similar to an allergic contact dermatitis, that do not develop,\nuntil the patient has been sensitized by prior exposure to the drug.\nThe action spectrum for most photoallergens is in the UVA range (light\ncoming through window glass causes problems). The response is not\ndose-dependent, and the reaction may spread to affect covered skin.\nFrequently, topical medicaments are implicated. Photopatch testing is\npositive.\nWhat should I do?\n• Withdraw the drug, if possible. Phototoxic reactions settle within\n a week. The signs of photoallergy (erythema) will also disappear\n within a week, but photosensitivity may persist for months after drug\n withdrawal (sometimes as long as 6 months).\n• A potent topical steroid applied daily will help to settle the\n inflammation. Systemic steroids may be required in severe reactions.\n• Sun protection with clothing, a hat, and a high-factor broad-spectrum\n UVA/UVB sunscreen is essential (see E pp. 338–9).\n• Photopatch testing may be helpful in suspected topical agent\n photoallergy, but less useful for systemic drug photosensitivity.\n• • Chronic phototoxicity increases the risk of skin cancer.",

    "text": "Polymorphic light eruption\nPolymorphic light eruption (PMLE, PLE) is the commonest of the idiopathic photodermatoses (see Box 16.5). It is sometimes known as\n‘sun allergy’ or prickly heat. PLE affects about 15% of the young adult\n♀ Caucasian population in northern Europe and may present in young\nadults or childhood. Genetic factors probably play some part in the\npathogenesis. The abbreviation is confusing—PLE is not a form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE).\n UVR (mostly UVA; sometimes UVA and UVB) provokes a T-cell\nresponse. The mechanism is unclear. It may be caused by failure of normal photoimmunosuppression. Phototesting can be normal, but provocation testing (UVA or solar-simulated light) usually provokes a rash.\nWhat should I look for?\n• A story of an itching or burning rash that erupts within 2h of\n exposure to UVR but, in some patients, may not develop for 24–48h,\n or even longer. (The history is usually diagnostic.)\n• A rash that fades within 1–6 days, leaving normal skin (no scars).\n• Erythematous papules, plaques, vesicles, or, less often, haemorrhagic\n blisters. The rash is polymorphic in its presentation in populations,\n but individuals usually have one form of the disease.\n• The problem usually presents in spring, but some patients only develop\n the rash when they go on holiday to a sunny climate on ‘holidayexposed sites’. Sunlight reflected from snow may provoke PLE.\n• The rash may be triggered by as little as 10min of direct sunlight.\n• Sunlight penetrating window glass (UVA) may cause the rash, as can\n unshielded fluorescent lights and UVA from sunbeds.\n• Chronically exposed skin on the face and hands is usually spared.\n• The rash usually erupts less frequently, as the summer progresses\n (‘hardening’), provided exposure to sunlight continues.\nWhat should I do?\n• Exclude subacute cutaneous LE (see E p. 402), solar urticaria and\n oral contraceptive (oestrogen)-induced photosensitivity (rare).\n• Management options include:\n • Potent topical corticosteroids for acute eruptions.\n • Gradual sunlight exposure to induce tolerance (may be difficult to\n achieve) and continued sun exposure to maintain tolerance.\n • Protective clothing: broad-brimmed hats, long sleeves\n (see E p. 338).\n • High-factor UVA/UVB sunscreens may prevent PLE. (UVB\n sunscreens may worsen PLE by allowing UVA through, but\n diminishing the protective immunosuppression produced by UVB).\n • Oral prednisolone 15–20mg/day for 2–3 days may be required to\n control an acute eruption, e.g. while on holiday.\n • Desensitization with UVB each spring. Treat x2–3/week for 3–5\n weeks. Patients must continue exposure to sunlight to maintain\n tolerance. Repeat annually if tolerance is not maintained.\n d hl b h l f l",

All are uncommon or rare, apart from PLE.\n\n Common\n • PLE: usually presents under age 30. Onset within hours of sun\n exposure, not minutes. Symmetrical rash (usually papulonodular\n or eczematous) that affects skin covered in winter. (Differential\n diagnosis: subacute cutaneous LE; see E p. 402.)\n\n Uncommon\n • Juvenile spring eruption: mainly boys in spring/summer. Itching,\n uncomfortable papules and vesicles on exposed helices of the\n ears. Usually the rest of the skin is not affected. Generally, the rash\n spontaneously resolves within 1–2 weeks but can recur.\n • Solar urticaria: may arise at any age. Itchy urticarial wheals\n appear within a few minutes of exposure to sunlight and last for\n <24h. (Differential diagnosis: drug-induced photosensitivity,\n erythropoietic protoporphyria.) Action spectra: UVA, UVB,\n and visible, including fluorescent, lights. Antihistamines and\n desensitization may be helpful.\n • Chronic actinic dermatitis: most often elderly men (90%)\n with multiple contact allergies. Action spectra: UVB, UVA ±\n visible. Compositae (plants) commonest contact allergy. Potent\n immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, are often required.\n\n Rare\n • Actinic prurigo: presents in childhood, commonest in American\n Indians/Mexicans. In the UK, strongly associated with HLADR4, in particular HLA-DRB1 0407. Itching papules evolve into\n chronic nodules and plaques. Rash is maximal in spring and\n summer. All exposed skin is affected but may involve covered\n sites (e.g. buttocks), so diagnosis often missed. May simulate\n atopic eczema. Solar cheilitis of the lower lip and conjunctivitis are\n common. Leaves pitted or linear scars. Usually resolves in early\n adulthood.\n • Hydroa vacciniforme: presents in childhood, usually boys. Rash\n within minutes of exposure. Tender, itching, erythematous papules\n evolve into haemorrhagic vesicles that crust and heal, leaving\n chickenpox-like scars. Associated with EBV infection (Japanese).\n Usually spontaneous improvement by adulthood.\n • Brachioradial pruritus: stinging or burning pain in the skin of\n forearms. Prevalence unknown. No rash. May be a form of lightinduced chronic neuropathic damage (see E Box 27.1, p. 548).\n\nFurther reading\nBylaite M et al.

Uroporphyrin also stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen in the\nskin, and this may explain some of the cutaneous features.\nWhat should I look for?\nPCT only affects the skin and is commonest in men. The presentation is\nsubacute, and the relationship to sun exposure may be missed.\n• Skin fragility: minor knocks produce erosions on the dorsum of\n the hands.\n• Itching or burning may precede blisters on sun-exposed skin.\n• Haemorrhagic vesicles, bullae, and crusted erosions, most often\n affecting exposed skin on the dorsum of the hands, face, and upper\n chest (see Fig. 16.3).\n• Superficial scars or milia (firm, white, pinhead-sized papules—sequelae of\n subepidermal blisters) (see E Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, p. 272).\n• Dystrophic calcification.\n• Hypertrichosis usually starts on the temples and affects the cheeks\n and/or forehead.\n• Blisters beneath the nail plate; painful discoloration (yellow, blue, or\n haemorrhagic) of the nail; loss of the lunula, onycholysis, or dystrophy.\n• Diffuse or reticulated hyperpigmentation of sun-exposed skin.\n• Waxy, yellowish thickening of sun-exposed skin (‘sclerodermoid’).\n• Normal teeth (unlike congenital erythropoietic porphyria).\n• Normal mucosa (involved in some autoimmune blistering diseases).\nWhat should I do?\n• Confirm the diagnosis, and exclude pseudoporphyria (see E p. 334)\n by measuring porphyrins in fresh samples of urine and stool\n (see E pp. 330–1). Fresh urine containing excess uroporphyrins is\n pink and fluoresces bright coral pink under UVA light (Wood light).\n• Biopsy a fresh blister for histology: subepidermal cell-poor blister,\n periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive glycoproteins at the BMZ and\n around blood vessels, and, for direct IMF, Igs deposited at the BMZ\n and around blood vessels.\n• Exclude risk factors, including hepatitis C (see Box 16.6).\n• Withdraw precipitating factors, including alcohol and oestrogens.\n• Advise strict sun protection (see E pp. 338–9).\n• Regular venesection (400–500mL every 2 weeks for 3–6 months)\n depletes iron stores.

    "text": "Photoprotection\nPatients with photosensitivity disorders must protect their skin from\nthe solar radiation that is responsible—UVA, UVB, visible light, or a\ncombination. Severe photosensitivity can have a catastrophic impact\non lifestyle—outdoor activities may be impossible. Sunglasses, clothing, hats, and shade (indoor activities when the sun is strongest between\n11.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m.) provide more effective photoprotection than\nsunscreens.\nClothing, hats, sunglasses, and windows\n• Clothing and hats should have a tight weave, sufficiently thick to block\n transmission of visible light (check the transmission of visible light by\n trying to look through the item held up to the sun).\n• Clothing should be loose-fitting (photoprotective fabrics are\n available). Patients should wear hats with broad brims (baseball caps\n do not protect the ears or neck), as well as a flap of cloth to cover\n the neck, shirts with long sleeves, trousers—not shorts, and shoes,\n rather than sandals. Some patients may need gloves for driving.\n• UV-blocking films can be obtained for window glass, car windows,\n and fluorescent lights, if required.\n• Sunglasses (wrap-around) to protect against UV radiation and\n blue light.\nSunscreens\n(See Boxes 16.9 and 16.10.)\n• Sunscreens may be physical or chemical.\n• Physical sunscreens (sunblocks): opaque creams containing particles\n (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide) reflect and scatter UVR (UVB and UVA)\n and visible light. Physical sunscreens are less cosmetically acceptable\n than chemical sunscreens, but more effective and safer (see Box\n 16.10, E Box 17.3, p. 347, and Box 17.4, p. 347).\n• Chemical sunscreens absorb UVR of certain wavelengths, either\n UVB or UVA. UVB chemical sunscreens protect against UVB-induced\n sunburn by blocking UVB. They contain cinnamates and other agents.\n UVA chemical sunscreens provide limited protection and contain\n chemicals such as oxybenzone. New dual UVB/UVA filters and\n photon absorbers are being developed.\n• Chemical sunscreens may cause contact dermatitis (irritant or\n allergic).\n• Patients using a UVB-absorbing sunscreen that prevents immediate\n erythema or sunburn should be warned not to stay out longer in the\n sun, to prevent exposure to excessive UVA.\n• Lips should be protected, as well as the skin.\n• The potential of topical or oral antioxidants to reduce photodamage\n is being investigated.\n• Patients avoiding UVB may become vitamin D-deficient\n (see Box 16.11).",

    "text": "Box 16.9 How much UV protection is provided by the\n sunscreen?\n • The sun protection factor (SPF) indicates the UVB photoprotection\n provided by a sunscreen. An SPF of 10 means that it takes ten times\n longer for the skin to go red than unprotected skin exposed to\n the same amount of UVB. An SPF of 20–30 is adequate for most\n patients.\n • The star rating (maximum 5) indicates the percentage of UVA\n absorbed in comparison to UVB. The UVA protection should be at\n least 1/3 of the labelled SPF.\n\n Box 16.10 Why is the sunscreen ineffective?\n • The sunscreen is not blocking the appropriate wavelengths. Broadspectrum combination sunscreens with an SPF of at least 15 and a\n high UVA protection are the most effective.\n • The sunscreen is not applied sufficiently thickly (at least six\n teaspoons of lotion are needed to cover the body of an average\n adult). Opaque sunblock creams do not have to be applied very\n thickly to be effective.\n • The sunscreen is not applied evenly to the skin or to all exposed\n skin, including lips, sides of the neck, ears, and temples.\n • The sunscreen is not reapplied every 2–3h or straight after\n swimming or activities causing sweating.\n • Patient allergic to the sunscreen (refer for photopatch testing).\n • Recommend physical barriers—sunglasses, clothing, hats, and\n shade—rather than encouraging patients to rely on sunscreens.\n\n Box 16.11 Advice on optimal vitamin D synthesis\n • UVB triggers conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to\n pre-vitamin D. Adequate levels of vitamin D are maintained if 15%\n of the body (face, arms, legs) receives about 1/3 of the minimal\n erythematogenic dose of UVB on most days of the week. In the UK,\n this equates to 15min of sun exposure on the arms, legs, and/or\n face x3/week from May to September (during the rest of the year,\n sunlight at this latitude is insufficient for vitamin D synthesis).\n • Patients who are very photosensitive and cannot tolerate any UVB\n radiation should take vitamin D supplements.\n • Vitamin D supplements may also be needed by individuals living in\n countries with low levels of UV for much of the year.\n • Vitamin D deficiency is common in the elderly, people with darker\n skin, or those who cover the skin when outdoors.\n\nFurther reading\nGonzález S et al Clin Dermatol 2008;26:614 26",

Patients\n with many moles tend to have a ‘signature naevus’, i.e. all their moles\n follow a pigmentation pattern that is characteristic for that patient.\n This is more easily visualized using dermoscopy.\n• Over time, the epidermal component is lost, and moles change into\n flesh-coloured or pale brown papules (intradermal melanocytic\n naevi), before disappearing in old age. A new pigmented growth in\n an elderly patient is much more likely to be a seborrhoeic wart, solar\n lentigo (see next section), or melanoma than a melanocytic naevus.\n• Congenital melanocytic naevi, usually >1cm in diameter (sometimes\n large and disfiguring = bathing trunk naevus) present at birth/early\n neonatal period. Large congenital melanocytic naevi >20cm and the\n presence of multiple satellite naevi are associated with an increased\n risk of malignant change and should be monitored.\n• Halo naevi: a white ring develops around a benign melanocytic naevus\n which gradually disappears, leaving a depigmented macule that usually\n eventually repigments. Halo naevi are common in adolescence and of\n no significance. Halo naevi in adults (age 40–50 years) may indicate\n melanoma elsewhere—check the skin, eyes, and mucosal surfaces\n (see Fig. 17.5).\nLentigo (plural = lentigines)\n• Simple lentigines are small, round, flat, evenly pigmented lesions that\n persist in winter, unlike freckles. The basal layer of the epidermis has\n increased numbers of individual melanocytes.\n• Numerous simple lentigines are found in some genetic disorders,\n e.g. Multiple lentignes syndrome, Carney complex, Peutz–Jeghers\n syndrome (see E p. 613).\n• Solar (senile) lentigines, 3–12mm in diameter, are flat, brown marks\n present on sun-damaged skin in older patients.\nMongolian spot\n• Slate-coloured macular areas of pigmentation are present in\n newborns—usually on the buttocks or sacrum where pigment\n may simulate a bruise and even be misdiagnosed as a sign of nonaccidental injury (see E Fig. 31.10, p. 615).\n• Mongolian spots are commonest in black or Asian infants and\n gradually disappear with age",

    "text": "Avoiding skin cancer\nExcess UVR is the main cause of skin cancer (see Boxes 17.1 and 17.2).\nEncourage people to enjoy outdoor activities (some UVB maintains the\nlevels of vitamin D), but those who have signs of sun damage, such as\nsolar keratoses or skin cancers, or are taking immunosuppressive drugs\nshould limit sun exposure (be sun-smart) and avoid sunburn. Spring and\nwinter sunshine in the UK has insufficient UVB to promote much synthesis of vitamin D, but adequate levels of vitamin D will be maintained\nfor most people through everyday exposure to the sun in the summer\nmonths, e.g. if the arms, legs, and/or face receive about 15min of sun\nexposure three times a week.\n For more about the sun and skin, including information about vitamin D,\nphotoprotection, and sunscreens, see E Chapter 16, pp. 338–9.\n A tan signals that the skin has been trying to protect itself from damage,\nwhile sunburn is foolish, unnecessary, and painful. Practical sun safety tips\nhave been provided in the UK Shunburn campaign and Australian ‘Slip–\nSlop–Slap–Seek–Slide’ (see Boxes 17.3 and 17.4).\n For signs of chronic sun damage (photoageing), see E Box 3.1, p. 43.\n\n Box 17.1 Ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer\n • UVB is more photocarcinogenic than UVA, but both contribute to\n the pathogenesis of skin cancer by damaging DNA.\n • Photodamaged DNA is usually repaired by nucleotide excision\n repair enzymes. Repair declines with age. Cumulative mutations\n lead to skin cancer by affecting the function of genes that regulate\n cell proliferation (oncogenes, e.g. RAS; tumour suppressor genes,\n e.g. p53) (see E pp. 336–7).\n • UV-induced immunosuppression may predispose to skin cancer by\n interfering with the recognition and elimination of abnormal cells.\n • Fair skin types I and II with red or blond hair, and severe sunburn\n in childhood or adolescence, increase the risk of developing skin\n cancer.\n • Chronic cumulative UVR, including PUVA (>200 treatments) and\n sunbeds, also predispose to skin cancer.\n • Chronic photosensitivity (e.g. drug-induced) with accelerated\n photoageing increases the risk of skin cancer.

    "text": "Keratinocyte skin cancers (1)\n\nBasal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer, BCC)\nBCC is the commonest skin cancer. BCCs grow slowly, virtually never\nmetastasize, and are locally invasive. Some variants can be locally\ndestructive. BCCs present predominantly in middle-aged Caucasians.\n(Also see E Gorlin syndrome, p. 542.)\nWhat should I look for?\n• Nodulocystic: dome-shaped, pearly papule with telangiectasia coursing\n over the surface, more easily identified with dermoscopy, described\n as ‘arborizing’ vessels which are in focus when magnified. (Common\n on the face and neck.) Stretch the skin gently to accentuate the\n translucent appearance and borders. Older tumours may present as\n ulcerated nodules (rodent ulcers) with smooth rolled pearly edges\n and telangiectasia across the surface (see Fig. 17.8). Remove the loose\n crust, so you can see the granulating fleshy base.\n• Superficial: one or more scaly erythematous plaques (most often on\n the trunk) with well-defined raised pearly edges. Stretch the skin\n gently to make the pearly border of superficial BCC more obvious,\n and differentiate from Bowen disease or fungal infection.\n• Pigmented: any BCC may contain pigment flecks (seen as ovoid globules\n under dermoscopy), but heavily pigmented tumours can simulate\n melanoma.

Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) is the commonest type in Caucasians (see Box 17.8).\n Most melanomas arise de novo; only 30–50% arise in pre-existing melanocytic naevi (usually SSM subtype). For risk factors, see E pp. 346–7.\nMelanoma accounts for 75% of deaths associated with skin cancer.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Moles that are irregular in colour, outline, or shape (see Figs. 17.10,\n 17.11, and 17.12,).\n• Use the ABCDE criteria to identify suspicious pigmented lesions:\n • Asymmetry in outline.\n • Border irregularity or blurring, sometimes with notching.\n • Colour variation (>3 colours) with shades of black, brown,\n and pink.\n • Diameter >6mm (cannot be covered by the end of a pencil).\n • Evolution: tumour that is changing in size, elevation, and/or colour.\n• Moles that stand out or look different from the others, i.e. ‘ugly\n duckling sign’. Better than ABCDE criteria for identifying nodular\n melanoma.\n• New or changing longitudinal pigmented streaks in nails, especially if\n associated with damage to the nail.\n• Pigment extending from the nail bed onto the skin of the nail fold\n (Hutchinson sign), suggesting melanoma, not subungual haematoma.\n• Moles that are symptomatic (itching, swollen, tender), but, more\n often than not, these turn out to be irritated benign melanocytic\n naevi, rather than melanoma.\n• Regional lymphadenopathy.\nWhat should I do?\n• Obtain a history of the tumour from the patient (see E p. 26).\n• Document risk factors (see Boxes 17.1 and 17.2).\n• Record the findings, including the site and size of the lesion.\n• Photography is helpful.\n• Dermoscopy is a useful tool to monitor multiple atypical naevi.\n• Refer any patient in whom you are concerned about a pigmented\n lesion for an urgent opinion. Prognosis is determined primarily by\n the Breslow thickness, and mortality increases significantly with\n increasing tumour thickness (see Tables 17.1 and 17.2).\n• Dermoscopy, performed by an expert, may help with diagnosis (see\n E p. 640).\n• Excision is the treatment of choice for suspicious pigmented lesions.",

May behave as a\nbenign reactive process or pursue an aggressive life-threatening course\n(see Box 17.9). 2° skin infections and malignancies (lymphoma) may\ncomplicate KS. Pathogenesis is multifactorial. Chronic lymphoedema\n(see E pp. 316–17) may predispose to KS, and HIV may exacerbate the\npathogenicity of HHV-8. Circulating HHV-8-infected endothelial precursor cells localize to sites, such as the leg, where unregulated spindle cell\nproliferation is driven by interactions between activated CD8+ T-cells,\nHHV-8-induced intracellular signalling pathways, products of oncogenes\n(viral and host), and inflammatory cytokines, including HHV-8-encoded\nIL-6 and, in AIDS patients, the product of the HIV-1 tat gene.\n If immunodeficiency is corrected, e.g. by withdrawing or reducing immunosuppression, KS may regress. KS lesions also shrink in\nHIV-positive patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy\n(HAART). Localized disease may be controlled with intralesional vinblastine, topical alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid) gel, topical imiquimod, radiotherapy, laser surgery, or cryosurgery. Systemic options for widespread\ndisease include IFN-α and multi-agent chemotherapy, e.g. anthracyclines\n(doxorubicin) or paclitaxel.

    "text": "Introduction\nCutaneous adverse drug reactions (see Box 18.1) are common (2–3%\nof hospitalized patients), the signs extraordinarily diverse, time courses\nvariable, and, worryingly, some are life-threatening. Alternative therapies, including vitamin or herbal supplements, may also cause problems. Reactions may be pharmacological or idiosyncratic (see Box 18.2).\nPredisposition is probably multifactorial, involving genetic and environmental factors (see Box 18.3).\n Advances in pharmacogenetics may help to predict which patients are\nlikely to benefit from, or react adversely to, certain drugs. For example,\nHLA-B*1502 allele in south-eastern Asian patients has been correlated\nwith carbamazepine-induced SJS–TEN; HLA-A*3101 allele is associated\nwith carbamazepine-induced reactions in Europeans, and genotyping for\nHLA-B*5701, which is linked to abacavir hypersensitivity, is used to screen\nHIV-positive patients prior to starting treatment.\n Cutaneous adverse reactions may not be recognized, if the reaction\nsimulates a condition such as eczema or if the medication has been taken\nfor months without problems. The exanthem of a viral infection looks\nlike a morbilliform drug reaction, but exanthems are more likely in children than in adults. To compound diagnostic difficulties, reactions may\nnot settle as soon as the drug is withdrawn—some persist for months—\nand generally there is no definitive test to confirm the diagnosis of ‘drug\nreaction’.\n These life-threatening or severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions are\ndiscussed in more detail elsewhere:\n• Anaphylaxis and angio-oedema (see E pp. 104–5).\n• Erythroderma (see E p. 108).\n• Stevens Johnson syndrome (see E pp. 116–17).\n• Toxic epidermal necrolysis (see E pp. 116–17).\n• DRESS (see E pp. 122–3).\n• AGEP (see E p. 124).\n• Anticoagulant-induced purpura fulminans and skin necrosis\n (see E pp. 102–3).\n• Vasculitis (see E pp. 436–9).\n\n Box 18.1 What is an adverse drug reaction?\n\n ‘An appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an\n intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard\n from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or\n alteration of the dosage regimen or withdrawal of the product’.\n Edwards IR and Aronson JK.

    "text": "Clinical approach\nIn any patient with a rash, ask yourself if the problem might be a manifestation of an adverse drug reaction and if this could be serious. Exclude\nother causes, such as viral infection, but retain a high index of suspicion.\nWhat should I ask?\n• What medicaments is the patient taking or applying to the skin\n (including herbal or traditional remedies, recreational drugs including\n kava, long-term medications such as the contraceptive pill, contrast\n medium, and depot injections)?\n• Has the patient been exposed to the medication before?\n• When medications were started (dates), and what is the temporal\n relation to the onset of the rash? You may have to ask the GP. The\n interval between the start of therapy and onset of reaction is rarely\n <1 week, unless the patient has had the drug before, or >1 month.\n• Is the reaction less severe if the drug dose is reduced, or does it settle\n if the drug is withdrawn? Pharmacological adverse reactions, unlike\n idiosyncratic reactions, are usually dose-dependent.\n• Any predisposing factors? (See Box 18.3.)\n• What are the symptoms—malaise, itch, mucosal swelling, cutaneous\n pain or burning (may indicate TEN), arthralgia, or wheeze?\nWhat should I do?\n• Full examination, including temperature and blood pressure.\n• Document the cutaneous signs—erythema, scale, macules, papules,\n urticarial wheals (no scale), pustules, vesicles or bullae, purpura—and\n decide on the predominant pattern of reaction.\n• Examine mucosae (mouth, conjunctiva, and genitalia).\n• Assess the likelihood of this being a serious reaction (see Box 18.4).\n• Consider how the adverse reaction is likely to evolve. Your next steps\n will be determined by the severity (see Box 18.5).\n• Document the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction (certain, likely,\n possible, or unlikely) and which drug(s) is/are implicated.\n• Contact pharmacy if you are not sure about the likelihood of a\n particular drug causing an adverse reaction.\n• Report any possible reaction to the regulatory agency—in the UK,\n return a completed yellow card to the Medicines and Healthcare\n Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Local, national, and\n international registries also exist for monitoring cutaneous drug\n reactions—consult the local dermatology department.\n• Ensure that the medical records state that the drug should be avoided\n in future (it may be possible to continue essential treatment, despite a\n morbilliform reaction), and notify the GP.\n• Explain the likely cause to the patient.\n• Arrange further investigations when resolved (see Box 18.6).\nFurther reading\nBarbaud A et al.

Drug withdrawal is not diagnostic\n immediately. Urticarial reactions settle in a few days, morbilliform\n rashes in 7–10 days. Other reactions may persist for >8 weeks.\n• Manage life-threatening adverse reactions promptly, e.g. anaphylaxis,\n erythroderma, TEN, vasculitis (see E p. 108, pp. 118–20).\n• Exclude systemic involvement: FBC (may have eosinophilia or\n lymphocytosis), renal function, liver function, complement levels.\n• Exclude infection with serological tests, if indicated, e.g. CMV, EBV,\n parvovirus B19 in patients with morbilliform rash; hepatitis B and C\n in urticaria; herpes simplex or mycoplasma in EM.\n• Consider a skin biopsy (unhelpful in simple morbilliform reactions).\n The histological findings may not be conclusive.\n• Emollients and soap substitutes relieve dryness (see E p. 655).\n• Moderately potent or potent topical corticosteroid ointments\n bd and sedating antihistamines reduce itch in morbilliform,\n eczematous, or lichenoid reactions (topical steroids are unhelpful in\n urticaria).

Warfarin inhibits protein C and protein S,\n inducing a hypercoagulable state.\n• Three to 5 days after starting warfarin, painful, erythematous,\n indurated plaques develop on fatty areas—breasts, hips, and\n buttocks. The large, irregularly outlined plaques become\n haemorrhagic, bullous, and eventually necrotic. Biopsy shows\n microthrombi in capillaries, venules, and veins.\n• 3 Treatment: stop warfarin; administer vitamin K and/or fresh\n frozen plasma to restore levels of protein C/S. Use another\n anticoagulant, e.g. heparin.\n• Heparin necrosis is rare. Presents 5–14 days after starting heparin.\n Erythema at injection sites (rarely distant sites) progresses to painful\n necrosis. Platelet aggregation is 2° to antibodies to heparin–platelet\n factor 4 complex. Platelets may fall. Stop heparin. Use non-heparin\n anticoagulant.\nCutaneous hyperpigmentation\n• Mechanisms of hyperpigmentation include increased melanin\n synthesis and deposition of drug or drug metabolites in the skin.\n• Photosensitivity may contribute to the colour change.\n• Ask if the colour change was preceded by erythema or itching to\n differentiate drug-induced pigmentation from post-inflammatory\n hyperpigmentation, e.g. after dermatitis, lichenoid rashes, or fixed drug\n eruptions (see E p. 378), particularly in individuals with dark skin.",

    "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis\nRA is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease that may be complicated\nby a systemic vasculitis and extra-articular manifestations including pericarditis, pleurisy, interstitial lung disease, iritis, and neuropathy. Rheumatoid\nvasculitis is most common in seropositive (i.e. RF- or anti-CCP positive)\npatients with long-standing nodular disease.\nRheumatoid arthritis: what cutaneous signs should\nI look for?\n• Pale, shiny, atrophic skin that is fragile and bruises easily.\n• Palmar erythema.\n• Bluish discoloration of fingertips and periungual erythema.\n• Nails may be ridged longitudinally and may have red lunulae.\n• Firm, skin-coloured, non-tender subcutaneous nodules, 5–40mm in\n diameter (20–30% of patients). Rheumatoid nodules are found most\n often on sites exposed to mild trauma or pressure, e.g. olecranon,\n knuckles (see Fig. 19.1), knees, and occiput (but may also be found in\n the lung). Nodules are linked to both seropositivity for RF and severe\n systemic manifestations. Nodules must be differentiated from tophi in\n chronic tophaceous gout (see Box 19.2).\n• Rarely nodules ulcerate or become infected.\n• Signs of small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis: palpable purpura,\n papulonecrotic lesions, or urticarial vasculitis (see E pp. 440–3).\n• Vasculitic lesions on the fingers, even in patients without systemic\n vasculitis, including papules, splinter haemorrhages, linear telangiectasia\n in the nail fold, petechiae, and brownish purpuric lesions of the nail\n fold or finger pulp (Bywater lesions) that may infarct and heal, leaving\n small scars. Painless, red-black lesions of the nail fold or finger pulp\n (microinfarcts of superficial dermal vessels) are also seen in SLE.\n• Vasculitis involving medium-sized cutaneous vessels presents with livedo\n reticularis, nodules, and painful punched-out ulcers along the lateral\n malleoli or pre-tibial region. Twenty percent of patients with severe\n vasculitis have digital gangrene.\n• Leg ulcers (10% of patients with RA) often multifactorial (see Box 19.1).\n• Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis: an uncommon condition of\n unknown cause that may be associated with severe RA, as well as\n other systemic autoimmune diseases. Tender, linear, indurated bands\n arise symmetrically on the axilla, trunk, and inner portions of the\n thighs (see E p. 373).\n• Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis, a condition of unknown cause\n associated with severe RA, characterized by papules, plaques, nodules,\n and urticarial wheals. Biopsy shows a dense dermal infiltrate of\n neutrophils. Neutrophilic dermatoses have also been described in SLE\n and dermatomyositis. May resemble Sweet syndrome (see E p. 518).\n• Blistering diseases, including mucous membrane pemphigoid, pemphigus,\n EBA, and subcorneal pustular dermatosis have been reported in\n association with RA (see E pp. 264–72).",

Look for livedo reticularis, nodules, and painful\n punched-out ulcers along the lateral malleoli or in the pre-tibial region.\n • Painful, rapidly enlarging ulcers with undermined bluish red borders\n may be caused by PG (see E p. 310).\n • Patients with Felty syndrome (RA, leucopenia, and splenomegaly) may\n develop chronic leg ulcers that are refractory to treatment.\n\n Box 19.2 Rheumatoid nodules or tophi?\n • Tophi are nodules formed by deposits of urate crystals in cartilage,\n tendons, and soft tissues.\n • Tophi tend to develop in patients with long-standing (>10y)\n polyarticular gout and severe hyperuricaemia.\n • Tophi are often found along the helix of the ear. Other common sites\n include the great toe, fingers, wrist, hand, elbow (olecranon bursa,\n when tophi may resemble rheumatoid nodules), and Achilles tendon.\n • Tophi, unlike rheumatoid nodules, may drain chalky material.\n • In gout, uric acid is often raised, and RF is usually negative.\n • Chronic tophaceous gout causes severe joint destruction, if not\n treated.\n\nFurther reading\nJorizzo JL and Daniels JC.

These are intended to be more\n clinically relevant and reflect new knowledge about lupus immunology.\n• Cutaneous manifestations are the first sign of SLE in around 25% of\n patients, and eventually >90% will develop cutaneous features; 70% of\n patients are photosensitive.\n• Patients with SLE may have cutaneous LE (see next section), as well as\n non-specific cutaneous signs, such as small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis,\n that may suggest SLE in the right setting. These non-specific signs are\n not diagnostic of SLE, and many may be seen in other connective tissue\n diseases (see E Box 19.5, p. 401).\nCutaneous lupus erythematosus\n• Cutaneous LE is an inflammatory skin disease that is a specific\n manifestation of LE. Some, but not all, patients with cutaneous LE may\n have SLE. Cutaneous LE is not a vasculitis, but a lichenoid reaction in the\n skin (see Box 19.4). Cutaneous LE is subdivided into:\n • Acute cutaneous LE (only seen in patients with active SLE)\n (see E p. 402, and Fig 19.2).\n • SCLE (see E p. 402, and Figs. 19.3, and 19.5,).\n • Chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE) (including DLE) (see E p. 404 and\n Figs. 19.4 and 19.6).\n• Patients may have >1 type of cutaneous LE, and all can occur in\n association with SLE.\n• It is confusing, because the terms SCLE and DLE are used in two ways,\n either to describe a type of skin lesion or to refer to subsets of patients\n who share certain clinical and immunological features but do not meet\n the criteria for SLE.",

The appearance of the\n periorbital erythema has been termed ‘racoon eyes’. Rash usually\n resolves over 4–6 months but may leave atrophy with telangiectasia.\n• Congenital heart block which is permanent (10% of infants). At\n 16–18 weeks’ gestation, Ro-positive mothers should be referred for\n fetal echocardiogram and further monitoring. The risk of congenital\n heart block is greatest when a previous child has had neonatal lupus\n or congenital heart block (5–12% recurrence rate in subsequent\n pregnancies).\n• Haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, elevated\n LFTs: all transient.",

Continue even when the disease is\n controlled (see E pp. 338–9 and Box 19.12).\n• Very potent topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate) ointment\n applied bd controls most localized cutaneous disease (use topical\n corticosteroids, even if the patient is also taking prednisolone for\n systemic disease). Apply before the application of sunscreen cream.\n Reduce the strength gradually to less potent preparations, such as\n mometasone furoate (potent—use x1/day), as soon as inflammation is\n controlled and lesions have flattened. Gradually reduce the frequency of\n application.\n• Scalp: clobetasol propionate scalp application at night.\n• Intralesional triamcinolone (10mg/mL) may be effective in resistant\n plaques of DLE.\n• Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% is worth trying, if facial DLE is not controlled\n by very potent topical corticosteroids.\n• Most patients respond to oral hydroxychloroquine 200mg bd (<6.5mg/\n kg/day) after 8–12 weeks. Combine with topical corticosteroids and\n photoprotection.\n• If the rash gets worse, reconsider the diagnosis—has the patient also\n got psoriasis, which can be exacerbated by antimalarials?

Patients\n taking hydroxychloroquine should see an optician annually.\n\n Box 19.10 Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is not\n responding to treatment\n\n If cutaneous LE has not improved after 4 weeks of treatment:\n • Ensure that the patient is using photoprotection.\n • Ensure that the patient is applying a very potent topical corticosteroid\n (many patients have steroid phobia). Topical corticosteroids should be\n used, even if the patient is also taking oral prednisolone for systemic\n disease.\n • Is the rash LE?

    "text": "Dermatomyositis\nDermatomyositis is a multisystem autoimmune disease, in which inflammatory skin changes are associated with a polymyositis of skeletal muscle.\nAdults and children of all races are affected, but ♀ are affected more often\nthan ♂.\n The prognosis is variable and unpredictable. Interstitial lung disease or an\nunderlying malignancy (20–25% of adult-onset patients; see Box 19.13) may\nbe fatal. The disease spectrum encompasses:\n• Cutaneous disease without muscle involvement—amyotrophic\n dermatomyositis. Muscle involvement may not develop until 20 years\n after the onset of cutaneous dermatomyositis.\n• Cutaneous and systemic disease (skin and muscle problems present\n concurrently in 60% of patients).\n• Polymyositis without skin changes (muscle involvement precedes\n inflammatory cutaneous disease in 10% of patients).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Ask about cutaneous symptoms; in dermatomyositis, the rash itches,\n burns, and is painful, unlike the rash of LE. Itch is worse in more severe\n disease.\n• Is the face swollen, particularly around the eyes, and how long does the\n swelling last? Dermatomyositis may simulate angio-oedema, but angiooedema is transient (see E p. 104, and Figs. 19.7 and 19.8).\n• Has the skin blistered (sometimes seen with intense oedema)?\n• Is the skin sensitive to sun? UV light exacerbates the rash in up to 50%\n of patients, but many patients are not aware that the skin is sensitive\n to light.\n• Is the scalp erythematous or scaly, or the hair thinning?\n Dermatomyositis, like LE, may cause hair loss and a scarring alopecia.\n• Seek evidence of a proximal myopathy; ask about getting out of chairs,\n going up and down stairs, brushing teeth, or reaching up.\n• Check for evidence of interstitial lung disease: dyspnoea, dry cough, and\n wheeze.\n• Probe for symptoms that suggest an internal malignancy: weight loss,\n changes in bowel habit.\n• Is the patient taking drugs such as hydroxycarbamide?

The frequency of the subtypes is different in adults and children. Some patients have >1 type of lesion.\n Autoantibodies (ANAs, anti-Scl70, anti-centromere antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, RF) may be detected, but their role in pathogenesis is\nunclear. Borrelia burgdorferi has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some\ncases of morphoea, but these findings have not been substantiated.\nPlaque morphoea\nPlaque morphoea, the commonest type of localized scleroderma, occurs\nmore often in adults than children. It is a self-limiting disease that slowly\nresolves over 3–5 years.\nWhat should I look for?\n• One or more smooth, erythematous patches, usually on the trunk.\n• Patches progress to smooth, indurated, shiny, white or yellowish plaques\n with violet borders—the ‘lilac ring’ (see Fig. 19.12).\n• Plaques hyperpigment, as they soften.\nWhat should I do?\n• Consider taking a deep elliptical skin biopsy that extends from normal\n into abnormal skin, but a biopsy is not always necessary.\n• No treatment is required, but a very potent topical corticosteroid\n ointment may be applied, until the inflammatory ring has resolved.\nDifferential diagnosis\n• Granuloma annulare: colour may be similar to morphoea, but look for\n a raised beaded margin in an annular configuration (see E Box 22.3,\n p. 469).\n• Erythema migrans (see E p. 148). Subtle erythema but no thickening.\n• Extragenital lichen sclerosus: resembles plaque morphoea, but the\n surface is slightly hyperkeratotic with follicular plugs. Lichen sclerosus\n (genital and extragenital) may occur with morphoea (see E pp. 288–9).\n• Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: a slow-growing fibrosing tumour\n that may present as a thickened plaque (see E p. 360).\nGeneralized morphoea\n• Much of the skin becomes sclerotic in this very rare variant.\n• Involvement of the chest wall may cause disabling restrictive lung\n defects.\n• Treatment is unsatisfactory, but phototherapy has been recommended.\nLinear scleroderma\nThis uncommon type of scleroderma is seen more often in children than\nadults.

Two-thirds of patients present with arthritis (skin\nsigns appear within months or a few years), and about 1/5 with skin signs\n(arthritis appears at any time). Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis may be a\nparaneoplastic disorder.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Systemic symptoms: weight loss, weakness, and fever.\n• A rapidly progressive, disabling, symmetrical arthritis, involving the DIP\n joints in 75% of patients (may be confused with Heberden nodes),\n sometimes with involvement of the PIP joints (producing an ‘opera\n glass’ deformity) and MCP joints, knees, shoulders, wrists, hips, ankles,\n feet, elbows, and vertebrae (see Box 19.26).\n• Smooth, reddish brown papules and nodules, ranging in size from a few\n mm to 2cm in diameter on the ears, nose, dorsum, and lateral aspect\n of fingers, neck, and sometimes the trunk. Nodules over the PIP, MCP,\n and DIP joints may resemble Gottron papules seen in dermatomyositis\n (see E Box 19.14, p. 411), but are not scaly or hyperkeratotic (see Fig.\n 19.15).\n• Periungual nodules and papules with a ‘coral bead’ appearance (see Fig.\n 19.15).\n• Papules and nodules on the lips, buccal mucosa, tongue, gingival, and\n nasal septum.\n• Associated diseases:\n • Hyperlipidemia (30–58% of cases).\n • • Malignancy (25% of cases), most commonly breast or stomach,\n but also cervix, colon, lung, ovary, lymphoma, leukaemia, sarcoma,\n and melanoma.\nWhat should I do?\n• Skin biopsy shows characteristic lipid-laden multinucleated giant cells of\n a foreign-body type with ‘ground glass’ cytoplasm.

EDS is\ncaused by mutations in genes that modify collagen proteins (see Table 19.1).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Skin: easy bruising or stretchy skin (apparent in early childhood).\n• Joint hypermobility: pain, sprains, or dislocation.\n• Surgical complications: delayed wound healing, post-operative hernia.\n• Family history of similar problems or, in vascular EDS, sudden death.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Soft, doughy, velvety, hyperextensible skin that, once released, quickly\n snaps back to its original state (skin returns slowly to its former position\n in cutis laxa). Test at a site that is not subjected to mechanical forces or\n scarring, e.g. flexor surface of the forearm.\n• Thin, transparent skin with easily visible vessels (chest, abdomen,\n limbs): seen in vascular EDS.\n• Subcutaneous nodules on the forearms and shins. Nodules may calcify.\n• Spontaneous bruising: bruises reappear in the same areas, often shins or\n knees, leaving hyperpigmentation.\n• Wide atrophic ‘cigarette paper’ scars over pressure points.\n• Molluscoid pseudotumours (small spongy tumours over scars and\n pressure points).\n• Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (see Box 19.28 and Fig. 19.16) (a rare\n association).\n• Joint hypermobility: influenced by age, sex, ethnicity, and family\n background. Do the little fingers dorsiflex passively to >90°? Do the\n elbows or knees hyperextend beyond 10°? Is it possible to flex the\n thumb down onto the flexor surface of the forearm? Hypermobility\n syndrome may be misdiagnosed as EDS.\nWhat should I do?\n• Confirm diagnosis with skin biopsy, biochemical analysis of collagen,\n and/or genetic testing. Refer to a clinical geneticist.\n• Patients should be managed in a specialist centre by a\n multidisciplinary team.\n• Echocardiography (mitral valve/tricuspid valve prolapse).\n• Advise patients with easy bruising to avoid contact sports.\n• Surgeons should take steps to minimize the risk of poor wound\n healing—avoid wound tension; use plentiful deep sutures; leave skin\n sutures in place for longer than usual; apply Steri-strip® to reduce\n stretching of scars.\nFurther reading\nDe Paepe A and Malfait F.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nWhat is cutaneous vasculitis?\nVasculitis (angiitis) is a necrotizing inflammation of the blood vessels\ncaused by various mechanisms (see Boxes 20.1 and 20.2). Necrosis of\nblood vessel walls leads to extravasation of RBCs (purpura), vascular\nobstruction, and tissue ischaemia or infarction. Vasculitis may affect vessels of different sizes in the skin, kidneys, gut, respiratory tract, peripheral nerves, and/or skeletal muscle.\n The histological findings in vasculitis may include:\n• Perivascular neutrophilic inflammation extending into vessel walls.\n• Swelling and injury of endothelial cells.\n• Necrosis of vessel walls.\n• Fibrinoid deposition around vessels (fibrinoid necrosis).\n• Extravasation of RBCs (clinically evident as purpura in the skin).\n• Nuclear dust, indicative of leukocytoclasis (fragmentation of the\n nuclei of neutrophils).\nSymptoms and signs vary, but palpable purpura is the hallmark of a smallvessel cutaneous vasculitis (see Box 20.2, and Figs. 20.1 and 20.2).\n Clinical findings should be integrated with the results of serological,\npathological, and imaging studies to reach a diagnosis. For classification\ncriteria, see Box 20.1.\nWhat is occlusive vasculopathy?\nVasculitis in the skin must be differentiated from an occlusive vasculopathy. Skin biopsy shows that the vessels are occluded, without significant\nvascular inflammation (see E p. 452 and pp. 312–15).\nPurpura: differential diagnosis\nSee E p. 70.",

The vasculitic\nlesions in idiopathic small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis are identical to\nthose in a small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis occurring as part of a systemic\ndisease associated with circulating immune complexes (see Box 20.3).\nIdiopathic small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis confined to the skin usually\nresolves within a few weeks or months. Ten percent have recurrent disease lasting months or years.\nWhat should I ask?\n• Explore the distribution and evolution of the rash.\n• Search for an underlying cause (see Box 20.3).\n• Enquire about symptoms such as orogenital ulcers, dry eyes, dry\n mouth, GI symptoms, myalgia, arthralgia, or joint swelling.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Distribution:\n • Vasculitis involves dependent areas such as the leg, sites of\n trauma, pressure sites (elbows, sacrum, waist band), or cool skin\n (tip of the nose, ears, fingers) (see Fig. 20.1).\n• Morphology:\n • Is the rash purpuric? Purpura, unlike erythema, does not blanch\n with light pressure (see Fig. 20.2).\n • Are the spots flat or raised (palpable)? Palpable purpura is the\n hallmark of small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis. Flat (macular)\n purpuric lesions are associated with non-inflammatory pathology\n (see E p. 70 and p. 74).\n • How does the rash evolve? In small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis,\n small round or oval erythematous macules rapidly become raised\n and purpuric. Papules may coalesce into larger polycyclic or\n annular lesions.\n • Are there blisters, pustules, or ulcers 2° to inflammation?\n • What is left? Vasculitis fades gradually over 3 or 4 weeks, leaving\n macular pigmentation (haemosiderin) or atrophic scars.\n• Note the position of leg ulcers, and check for signs of stasis or arterial\n disease (see E Box 15.4, p. 299). Is there purpura around the edge of\n the ulcer (a feature of some vasculitic ulcers)?\n• Look for livedo reticularis, retiform purpura, or ulcerated nodules\n indicating a necrotizing vasculitis affecting deeper vessels or an\n occlusive vasculopathy, e.g. cholesterol emboli (see E p. 452).\n• Is there evidence of a systemic disease (see Box 20.3)?\nWhat should I do?\nSee Box 20.4.\nFurther reading\nGoeser M et al.

Rheumatoid vasculitis is\n commonest in seropositive patients with long-standing nodular disease.\n• Malignancies: 5%. Most often lymphoproliferative disorders,\n e.g. Hodgkin disease, MF, lymphosarcoma, adult T-cell leukaemia,\n multiple myeloma.\n• Inflammatory bowel disease.\n• Others, e.g. prolonged exercise such as long-distance walks;\n marathons may trigger a cutaneous vasculitis on the leg—‘exerciseinduced purpura’. This fades within days.\n\nBox 20.4 What should I do?\n\nInvestigations\n• Guiac testing of stool (in children with IgA vasculitis).\n• Urinalysis, including microscopy to check for cellular casts.\n• FBC.\n• Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP).\n• Renal function tests, LFTs, hepatitis B/C viral serologies.\n• Complement levels (C3, C4), cryoglobulins if C4 is low.\n• Igs, RF, and ANA.\n• ANCA if evidence of systemic disease.\n• CXR if concern about interstitial lung disease.\n• Skin biopsy: cutaneous vasculitis can be diagnosed using standard\n histological techniques, but the histology is unlikely to reveal the cause,\n exclude systemic disease, or distinguish one form of systemic vasculitis\n from another. Take a biopsy from a purpuric papule about 12–24h old.\n• Direct IMF of frozen tissue may be requested to look for deposits\n of Ig in vessel walls, e.g. IgA, but it is not necessary to demonstrate\n immune complexes to diagnose vasculitis. Immune complexes are\n not found in older lesions, so take a punch biopsy from the edge of\n a fresh lesion, and immediately freeze the specimen.\nManagement of small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis\n• Eliminate precipitating agents (drugs or infections), but it may take\n several weeks for vasculitis to settle.\n• Minimize local triggers by avoiding cooling or trauma and reducing\n stasis (elevate the legs; provide support stockings; encourage exercise).\n• Most patients with small-vessel vasculitis limited to the skin do not\n require systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n• If cutaneous vasculitis is symptomatic, dapsone (50–200mg/day)\n may be helpful. Alternatives include colchicine (0.5mg bd) and lowdose methotrexate (10–25mg/week).\n• Severe cutaneous vasculitis may require short courses",

It is a septal panniculitis.\n Vasculitis is not a feature of typical EN.\n• EN may be a delayed hypersensitivity response to infection or to\n an underlying inflammatory disease (see Box 21.2), but no cause is\n identified in about 1/3 of cases. Cases usually occur in the first half of\n the year, possibly because of an increase in streptococcal infections.\n• Most cases appear between the second and fourth decades, with\n a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 30. EN is commoner\n in women.\n• Prognosis depends on the underlying disease. Idiopathic EN is selflimiting with an excellent prognosis. Relapses are uncommon.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Underlying triggers (see Box 21.2).\n• A prodrome with fever, malaise, arthralgia, and headache.\n• Tender, erythematous (no purpura), warm nodules, measuring\n 1–5cm or more in diameter (see Fig. 21.2).\n• A symmetrical distribution on the shins, ankles, and knees (for\n differential diagnosis, see Box 21.3 and Table 21.1).\n• Less often, nodules appear on the arms or trunk.\n• EN does not ulcerate.\n• Sometimes GI problems such as abdominal pain, vomiting, or\n diarrhoea.\n• Nodules fade over 2–6 weeks (more quickly in children), leaving a\n purplish, bruise-like appearance that slowly resolves.\n• Absence of scarring (nodules do not leave a depression—contour\n goes back to normal).\n• A chronic migratory variant (subacute nodular migratory panniculitis,\n erythema nodosum migrans) is much less common and usually\n presents as a single tender, indurated, erythematous plaque that\n slowly enlarges peripherally, while clearing centrally.\nWhat should I do?\n• Check FBC, ESR, urinalysis, and chest radiography.\n• Further investigations should be guided by the history, examination,\n and local prevalence of aetiological factors such as bacterial, viral,\n fungal, or protozoal infections.\n• If required, take a deep elliptical biopsy that includes fat (a biopsy is\n usually unnecessary).\n• Manage any underlying problem such as infection.\n• Provide pain relief with NSAIDs.\n• Elevation may relieve pain in acute disease.\n• Support stockings control swelling and may speed resolution.\n• Potassium iodide 300–900mg/day has been recommended in\n persistent disease.\n• Rarely oral corticosteroids are required but exclude an infection",

    "text": "Nodular vasculitis (erythema induratum\nof Bazin)\n\nWhat is nodular vasculitis?\nNodular vasculitis is the commonest form of lobular panniculitis with vasculitis. It is considered to be a ‘reactive disorder’, but, in many patients,\nno underlying trigger is identified.\n Bazin described this form of vasculitis in 1861, and a link with TB was\nrecognized in the early 1900s. TB is still the commonest infectious trigger, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA has been demonstrated in cutaneous biopsies.\n Nodular vasculitis is commonest on the back of the legs of obese\nmiddle-aged women in whom chronic venous stasis, previous thrombophlebitis, and/or cooling may play some part in the localization to the leg.\nThe condition tends to run a protracted course over many years.\nWhat should I look for?\n• History of recurrent nodules that form slowly and equally slowly\n resolve.\n• Tender, erythematous, indurated nodules and plaques on the calves\n (rather than the shins) of fat legs where the skin is cyanotic and cold.\n Nodules develop most often in winter months.\n• Ulceration of nodules (unlike EN; see Table 21.1).\n• Atrophic scars (depressions) where ulcerated nodules have healed.\n• Venous insufficiency of the lower legs (a frequent association).\n• Any indications in history and examination of an underlying disease\n such as TB.\nWhat should I do?\n• Take a deep incisional biopsy to demonstrate the pathology.\n• Exclude TB by chest radiography, Mantoux test, and/or a TB IFN-γ\n release assay (QuantiFERON® TB Gold test or T-SPOT® TB test).\n• Treat the underlying disease, if identified.\n• Control venous stasis by weight loss, compression bandages,\n elevation, and exercise.\n• Relieve pain with NSAIDs.\n• Corticosteroids are not usually indicated.",

    "text": "Uncommon causes of panniculitis\nα-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis\nAAT is a circulating serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA1). AAT inhibits\nenzymes (e.g. trypsin, collagenase, elastase) involved in the proteolytic\ndegradation of tissues, has effects on the immune system, and inhibits\nthe activation of complement.\n Mutations in the AAT gene may cause enzyme deficiency or abnormal\nenzyme function. Severe deficiency mainly affects Caucasians and has a\nprevalence of 1:2000–1:5000 in Europe. Patients may develop emphysema, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, RA, vasculitis,\nand/or angio-oedema. Rarely, AAT deficiency is associated with relapsing lobular panniculitis accompanied by fat necrosis (seen in adults more\noften than children). Patients with partial deficiency of AAT may have\npanniculitis without systemic disease.\n Enzyme function may be significantly impaired, despite normal serum\nlevels of AAT, but most cases associated with panniculitis have the ZZ\nphenotype with AAT levels below normal.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Family history of AAT deficiency.\n• Recurrent painful, erythematous plaques and nodules in a proximal\n distribution on the hips, thighs, and buttocks.\n• Panniculitis that is induced or exacerbated by trauma.\n• Characteristically, nodules suppurate with the release of oily material\n (uncommon in other forms of panniculitis).\n• Associated diseases, including early-onset emphysema, hepatitis and/\n or cirrhosis, vasculitis (ANCA-positive), and angio-oedema.\nWhat should I do?\n• Take a deep biopsy from a fresh nodule to reveal suppurative lobular\n panniculitis.\n• Only check the serum level of AAT and the AAT phenotype if the\n clinical and histological findings are compatible with panniculitis\n associated with AAT deficiency.\n• Dapsone may be effective in mild cases (inhibits neutrophil migration\n and function).\n• Oral tetracyclines (doxycycline 200mg bd) may have a direct effect\n on serine proteases released from neutrophils and can help some\n patients.\n• NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine have been recommended.\n• Replacement therapy using IV infusions of AAT controls panniculitis\n effectively.\nPancreatic panniculitis\nA characteristic form of panniculitis has been described (rarely) in association with a number of pancreatic diseases, including:\n• Acute or chronic pancreatitis.\n• Pancreatic islet cell tumours.\n• Ductal adenocarcinoma",

Type 1 diabetes (autoimmune) is less common than type 2 diabetes\n(defective insulin action or secretion).\nDiabetes: what should I look for?\n• Linear periungual telangiectasia without loss of capillary loops—\n compare with systemic sclerosis in which capillaries are lost.\n• Periungual erythema, ragged cuticles, and tender fingertips.\n• Diabetic hand syndrome: scleroderma-like thickening on the\n dorsum of the hands, with knuckle pads and papules on periungual\n skin and the sides of fingers; and sclerosing tenosynovitis of palmar\n flexor tendons, with stiffness of MCP and PIP joints. Mild flexion\n contractures may limit the ability to press the hand flat on a table or\n to oppose the palmar surfaces of fingers. May also have Dupuytren\n contractures and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n• Diabetic dermopathy or shin spots (round or oval erythematous\n papules or pigmented scars on shins). Associated with microvascular\n complications.\n• Feet: neuropathic ulcers (check shoes), onychomycosis, or\n tinea pedis.\n• Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum on shins. May ulcerate (see\n E p. 468).\n• Diabetic bullae: asymptomatic bullae on non-inflamed skin. Seen\n most often on legs and feet. Cause is unknown, but the differential\n includes bullous impetigo, PCT, and autoimmune blistering diseases.\n Bullae resolve without scarring in 2–3 weeks.\n• Vitiligo: well-demarcated, smooth, depigmented macules/patches.\n Check for other autoimmune diseases (see E pp. 486–7).\n• Lipohypertrophy (like a lipoma) at sites of insulin injections. Lipoatrophy\n is uncommon, since recombinant human insulin introduced.\n• Lipodystrophy (acquired or inherited)—very rare cause of insulin\n resistance with diabetes and hypertriglyceridaemia (see Box 22.4).\n• Neuropathic itch (see E pp. 548–9).\n• Eruptive xanthoma (itchy, yellow papules on extensor surfaces and\n buttocks) associated with elevated triglycerides (see E p. 470).\n• Skin tags and (pseudo)acanthosis nigricans: velvety thickening\n in skinfolds—in obese patients with insulin resistance and high\n circulating insulin levels. Insulin has a growth hormone-like action\n on skin. Encourage patients to lose weight. Acanthosis nigricans may\n respond to a topical retinoid such as 0.05% tazarotene gel.

    "text": "Hirsutism and hypertrichosis\nHirsutism is defined as excess terminal (coarse, pigmented) hair that\nappears in a ♂ pattern in a woman. It affects about 10% of Caucasian\nwomen (more in Mediterranean women) and usually results from subtle\nincreases in androgens (see E p. 380), but rarely may presage a serious\nunderlying condition (see E pp. 94–5 and Box 22.7).\n In contrast, hypertrichosis is independent of androgens. The increased\nhair growth may be localized or generalized, and affects any part of the\nbody. Hypertrichosis may be racial, hereditary, or be caused by drugs\n(see E p. 380) and some disease (see E pp. 94–5 and Box 22.7).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Enquire about onset, sites involved, and progression. Sudden onset\n and rapid progression may indicate a virilizing tumour (rare).\n• What is the psychological impact? What treatments have been tried?\n• Look for symptoms suggesting hyperandrogenism or polycystic\n ovary syndrome (PCOS), e.g. acne, androgenetic alopecia, menstrual\n irregularities, or infertility (see E pp. 476–7), hyperprolactinaemia\n (galactorrhoea), adrenal pathology (see E p. 482), pituitary tumour\n (visual disturbance, headache), late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n (hirsutism, prepuberty, premature pubarche, menstrual irregularity, 1°\n amenorrhea), or virilization (increased libido, deep voice).\n• Drug history, including oral contraceptives (see E p. 380 and Box 22.7).\n• Family history of hirsutism, PCOS, androgenetic alopecia, or\n congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Exclude hypertrichosis by ensuring excess hair is limited to androgendependent areas, and score using the Ferriman–Gallwey scale (see\n Box 22.8).\n• Other cutaneous manifestations of excess androgens: ♀ pattern hair\n loss—the frontal hairline is preserved in women (unlike men), but\n hair on the vertex of the scalp thins diffusely (see E p. 480); acne\n and seborrhoea (oily skin on the central face).\n• Signs of PCOS (the commonest cause) or another underlying cause\n (see Box 22.7).\n• • Signs of virilization: deep voice, cliteromegaly, breast atrophy,\n muscularity. If present, examine for an ovarian or adrenal mass.\n• Signs of a visual field defect if you suspect a pituitary adenoma.\nWhat should I do?\n• Investigation is recommended in moderate or severe hirsutism;\n hirsutism of any severity if it is sudden in onset or progressing rapidly;\n and hirsutism associated with menstrual irregularity or infertility,\n central obesity, acanthosis nigricans, or cliteromegaly (see Box 22.9).\n• For management of hirsutism, see E pp. 478–9.\n• Treat the underlying cause.\nFurther reading",

    "text": "Management of hirsutism\nWomen with hirsutism may be too embarrassed to discuss the condition\nor what they have been doing to remove the excess hair. Hirsutism can\nhave a major impact on quality of life, and many women will be anxious,\nhave a low self-esteem, or have concerns about sexual self-worth.\n Although there is no single easy answer, treatments can make a difference, and most women will value the opportunity to talk to a sensitive\nphysician about what can be done. Any underlying cause of androgen\nexcess should be controlled, and drugs contributing to hirsutism withdrawn. The choice of treatment for reducing or removing hair will depend\non the patient’s preference, the distribution and severity of hirsutism,\nand the cost of treatment (most are not provided through the NHS).\nTopical treatments\n• Bleaching with hydrogen peroxide preparations may make dark facial\n hair less obvious but can be irritant.\n• Depilatory creams or foams containing thioglycolates that dissolve\n hair are widely available but smell unpleasant, are irritant, and are not\n very effective for coarse hair.\n• Eflornithine cream (inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase) applied bd\n reduces the rate of growth of hair after 6–8 weeks. May irritate or\n induce acne. Once treatment is discontinued, the hair growth returns\n to pretreatment levels. Eflornithine is helpful in combination with\n mechanical treatments.\nMechanical treatments\n• Shaving: regrowing hairs have a blunt tip which may make them\n look thicker than before. Although women are prepared to shave\n their legs or axillae, most do not find it acceptable to shave the face.\n Shaving may cause a folliculitis, particularly on the thighs.\n• Epilation: plucking, waxing, threading, or sugaring to extract hairs.\n Contrary to popular opinion, epilation does not make hairs grow\n back more thickly. Epilation is uncomfortable. Irritation and folliculitis\n are common. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may be a\n problem in dark skin.\n• Electrolysis is effective and can permanently destroy some hair\n follicles (about 60%), but the outcome depends on the skill of the\n operator. Complications include scarring and infection.\n• Laser hair removal (photoepilation) is most effective for dark hairs on\n fair skin (laser energy is absorbed by melanin in the hair follicle, and\n not the surrounding epidermis). Treatment interrupts hair growth\n temporarily, but regrowing hairs may be finer and lighter. Some\n permanent hair loss may be achieved after repeated treatments.\n Laser treatment is considerably more expensive than electrolysis but\n is also more effective and faster.\nOral therapy\nSee Box 22.12.",

    "text": "Male and female pattern hair loss\nSynonyms: male pattern baldness, androgenetic alopecia, genetic hair loss.\n Hair loss (alopecia) is common as people age, but the pattern of loss\nis different in males and females. Androgens play a pivotal role in male\npattern hair loss, but their role in female pattern hair loss is less certain,\nand other mechanisms may be involved. Genetically determined susceptibility is important (prevalence varies in different populations).\nMale pattern hair loss—what should I look for?\n• About 25% of men begin to lose hair by age 30, and 50% by age 50.\n• Androgens cause follicular miniaturization, with progressive decrease\n in the width of the hair shaft.\n• Receding frontal hairline is common, particularly on the temples (may\n commence in the mid teens).\n• Gradual thinning of the hair on the vertex is eventually followed\n by complete loss of hair over the vertex (loss may be preceded by\n curling and coarsening of hair—acquired progressive kinking).\n• A rim of hair is retained around the back and sides of the scalp\n (occipital follicles are not dependent on androgens and are a source\n of follicles for hair transplants).\nFemale pattern hair loss—what should I look for?\n• Female pattern loss occurs any time after the onset of puberty.\n Prevalence varies widely but increases to 29–42% in women aged >70.\n• Some report increased shedding; others complain of gradual diffuse\n thinning over the crown, usually with sparing of the frontal hairline.\n• Women may say ‘I can see my scalp’ or complain central parting gets\n sunburnt. There may be a family history of androgenetic alopecia.\n• Density of hair on top of the scalp is reduced in a diffuse central\n pattern. Other patterns include accentuated loss frontally or loss\n localized to the vertex. Hair pull (see E Box 3.3, p. 45) may be\n positive in early loss, but usually negative.\n• Temporal thinning is common, but, unlike men, women do not\n progress to complete balding on the vertex. In advanced female\n pattern hair loss, when hair may be very sparse over the top of the\n scalp, a rim of hair is still retained along the frontal margin.\n• Rapidly progressive hair loss in a male pattern suggests virilization—\n look for other signs/symptoms, e.g. oligomenorrhoea or\n amenorrhoea, hirsutism, severe acne, or cliteromegaly (see\n E p. 474).\n• Some hyperandrogenic women show female pattern of hair loss.\n• Exclude other causes of diffuse non-scarring alopecia (see\n Boxes 22.13 and 22.14).\n• Ask about menstrual history, dieting, recent illnesses, and drugs.\nWhat should I do?\nSee Box 22.15.\nFurther reading",

If\n chronic (lasts months to years), can be difficult to distinguish from\n female pattern hair loss.\n• Diffuse alopecia areata: positive hair pull, may have lost hair at other\n sites (see E p. 488). Dermoscopic features include cadaverized\n hairs, exclamation mark hairs, broken hairs (black dots), and yellow\n dots. Look for nail pitting and autoimmune thyroid disease.\n• Traction alopecia: is the patient pulling hair back tightly?\n• Systemic disease or drugs (see Box 22.14).\n\nBox 22.14 Systemic causes of diffuse non-scarring alopecia\n• Iron deficiency (often associated with heavy menses).\n• Hypothyroidism (often frontal hair loss) or hyperthyroidism (often\n parietal hair loss), but may resemble female pattern hair loss.\n• Hypoparathyroidism, hypopituitarism.\n• SLE (frontal alopecia is commonest).\n• Protein malnutrition, crash dieting, or anorexia nervosa.\n• Severe chronic disease, including malignancy.\n• Cytotoxic drugs, vitamin A, and oral retinoids.\n\nBox 22.15 Management of male and female pattern\nhair loss\n• If the woman has no symptoms or signs suggesting hyperandro\n genaemia, investigation of the androgen status is not indicated.\n• Investigate and treat coexisting problems, e.g iron deficiency.\n• Explain to women that they are unlikely to go bald, shorter layered\n hair styles make hair look fuller, and boosting the volume of hair\n with rollers, mousses, or a gentle permanent wave will not increase\n hair loss—this reassurance may be all that is required.\n• Explain that treatment will only have a modest impact (stabilizes\n loss, thickens residual hair shafts) but will not reverse hair loss.\n• Topical 2% or 5% minoxidil solution or foam bd may produce some\n regrowth in men and women. Minoxidil should halt progression,\n while the treatment is being used, and can produce some regrowth\n and thickening. Treat for 12–24 months.\n• Women—anti-androgens: the combined oral contraceptive\n containing the progestin cyproterone acetate, or spironolactone\n up to 100mg/day.

    "text": "Vitiligo\nVitiligo is a common acquired skin condition in which epidermal melanocytes are lost, leading to complete loss of pigment, i.e. depigmentation,\nrather than hypopigmentation (partial pigment loss) (see Fig. 22.5).\nAverage age of onset is 20 years, but vitiligo may commence in childhood.\nUp to a third report a family history of vitiligo. Psychological impact may\nbe profound, particularly in individuals with darkly pigmented skin.\nVitiligo is associated with various autoimmune diseases, including thyroid\ndisease (see Box 22.19).\nWhat should I look for?\n• Smooth (no scale) white (depigmented) macules and/or patches.\n• Are you sure that the pale skin is abnormal? Might it be possible that\n the rest of the skin is hyperpigmented? For example, melasma may\n be confused with facial vitiligo, when hyperpigmented facial lesions\n surround normal, but pale-looking, skin.\n• Pigment loss may be non-segmental (localized, generalized,\n or acrofacial) or segmental (unilateral following a dermatomal\n distribution; one or more segments may be affected) (see Table 22.2).\n• Non-segmental: common on fingers, wrists, axillae, groins, perioral\n and periorbital skin, and genitalia. Check sites sensitive to pressure,\n friction, or trauma (Koebner phenomenon), e.g. belt-line, beneath\n the watch strap.\n• Rims of depigmented skin around melanocytic naevi—halo naevi—\n are ten times commoner in vitiligo. The melanocytic naevi regress,\n leaving depigmented macules (Fig. 17.5).\n• Genital vitiligo—the patient may be too embarrassed to report the\n vitiligo. Lichen sclerosus may coexist with genital vitiligo (see\n E p. 288).\n• White hairs on eyelashes and scalp, as well as white body hair within\n areas of vitiligo (leukotrichia).\n• A ‘trichrome’ appearance with a white depigmented centre, a\n surrounding light brown zone of varying width, and dark brown\n normal skin. Seen rarely in developing patches in dark skin.\n• Inflammation at the advancing edge of a macule—uncommon.\n• Mucosae may be affected in patients with dark skin.\nWhat should I do?\n• Exclude other causes of pigment loss (see E pp. 89–90).\n• Assess the psychological impact of vitiligo using DLQI (see E p. 32.\n• Check thyroid function (high prevalence of thyroid antibodies).\n• Examine the skin under Wood light to confirm diagnosis (the\n depigmented skin appears bright white), and determine the extent of\n disease, particularly in pale skin.\n• Record the extent of vitiligo with photographs.\n• Management is challenging—sun protection is essential\n (see Box 22.20).",

    "text": "Alopecia areata\nAlopecia areata is a common (1–2% of the population) T-cell-mediated\ncause of non-scarring alopecia. Presents at any age but most often affects\nchildren and young adults when it may cause considerable psychological\ndistress, particularly if widespread. Genetic and environmental factors\nare involved in the pathogenesis, and it is associated with autoimmune\ndiseases, including vitiligo and autoimmune thyroiditis, as well as with\natopy. T-cell clustering around the hair bulb of growing (anagen) hair follicles disturbs the normal cycle of hair growth. Hair follicles in the growing part of the cycle are pushed prematurely into the resting (telogen)\nphase. Affected follicles have potential for regrowth, as there is no scarring. Patients have circulating IgG antibodies to anagen hair follicles, but\nthese may not be pathogenic.\n Recent evidence implicates cytotoxic T-cells and the janus kinase\n(JAK) pathway in pathogenesis, and a potential role for JAK inhibitors in\ntreatment. Disease is both dynamic and unpredictable. Stress may trigger onset. Severity ranges from transient loss in few patches to persistent\nloss of all scalp and body hair. It is chronic in 7–10% of patients.\n Poor prognostic factors include:\n• Young age of onset. Family history of alopecia areata (20% of patients).\n• History of autoimmune diseases or atopy.\n• Nail involvement. Extensive hair loss or ophiasic pattern of loss (see\n below). Recurrent episodes of hair loss or long-standing loss.\nWhat should I look for?\n• One or more well-circumscribed, smooth, round, or oval patches of\n non-scarring alopecia on the scalp (commonest pattern). Skin is not\n inflamed; patches are asymptomatic (for differential, see Box 22.21).\n• Often sparing of grey or white hair. Regrowing hairs white at first.\n• Exclamation-mark hairs (short and tapering to a point)\n seen at the edge of patches of hair loss. Easier to see using a\n dermatoscope: cadaverized hairs (black dots), yellow dots, and\n clustered short vellus hairs.\n• In active disease, hair pull may be positive for telogen hairs (resting\n hairs) or dystrophic anagen hairs at the edge of the patch; >6 hairs\n are pulled out by the root, when a small clump is tugged gently but\n firmly (see E Box 3.3, p. 45).\n• Patches of hair loss in the beard area, loss of eyebrows or eyelashes.\n• Nail pitting (about 10% of cases).\n• Other patterns of loss include:\n • Band of loss around the periphery of the scalp (ophiasic pattern).\n • Diffuse thinning that resembles ♀ pattern hair loss (see E p. 480).\n • Complete loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis). Sudden onset of\n alopecia totalis can make a patient’s hair appear to ‘go white\n overnight’, because white hairs are retained.\n • Complete loss of scalp hair and body hair (alopecia universalis).\nWhat should I do?\nS B 22 21 22 22 d 22 23",

    "text": "Box 22.21 Alopecia areata: differential diagnosis\n The characteristic dermoscopic findings of alopecia areata will help to\n exclude other diagnoses such as:\n • Telogen effluvium: hair loss is generalized and not patchy.\n • Tinea capitis: the scalp is erythematous and scaly, but signs may be\n subtle, particularly in infections caused by T. tonsurans.\n • Trichotillomania (deliberate hair pulling): broken hairs or regrowing\n hairs are still firmly anchored to the scalp.\n • Drug-induced anagen effluvium may mimic diffuse alopecia areata.\n • ♀ pattern hair loss (see E p. 480) may mimic diffuse alopecia areata.\n • SLE (usually frontal alopecia).\n • 2° syphilis (patchy moth-eaten appearance).\n • Early scarring alopecia (see E Box 3.2, p. 45).\n\n Box 22.22 Investigations in alopecia areata\n • Usually none required. Although autoimmune diseases are increased in\n frequency, current UK guidelines do not recommend routine screening.\n Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may be low and are inversely\n correlated with disease activity. If diagnosis is in doubt, consider:\n • Fungal culture of plucked hairs.\n • Skin biopsy: rarely needed, but can distinguish from ♀ pattern\n hair loss.\n • Serology for SLE and syphilis.\n\n Box 22.23 Management of alopecia areata\n • Difficult to treat. Some treatments induce hair growth, but none\n affects the course of disease or the long-term outcome.\n • Remember that most patients (80%) have spontaneous regrowth of\n hair in any individual patch within 12 months of onset.\n • Potent topical corticosteroids are safe and used widely, although\n there is limited evidence that they are effective. Intralesional\n corticosteroids temporarily stimulate tufts of hair growth, but\n repeated injections cause atrophy. Intralesional steroids near the\n eye may cause cataract or raised intraocular pressure, but lower\n concentrations can be used cautiously at these sites.\n • Other treatments that have been tried include short courses of\n oral prednisolone, contact immunotherapy (50–60% can show\n a response, but patients with extensive hair loss are less likely to\n respond), dithranol and other irritants, and phototherapy (high\n relapse rates with PUVA). Patients with extensive loss or recurrent\n episodes may benefit from psychological support or contact\n Alopecia UK, available at Mhttp://www.alopeciaonline.org.uk.\n • For some, a wig or hairpiece may be the best option.\n\nFurther reading",

At least 20 different\nproteins can form the extracellular deposits of non-functional β-pleated\nsheets that typify amyloid fibrils. Fibrils stain with Congo red dye and\nproduce apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Amyloid protein may be deposited in any tissue, including the kidney, GIT, heart, skin,\nmuscle, brain, and/or blood vessels. Accumulation of protein eventually\ncauses organ failure (often renal).\n Reactive systemic amyloidosis (AA) develops in association with\nchronic inflammation, including chronic infections, e.g. leprosy, TB, or\nosteomyelitis, and chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g. RA and ankylosing\nspondylitis. Amyloidosis is also a frequent complication in patients with\nchronic kidney disease on maintenance haemodialysis. Rarely, systemic\namyloidosis may be hereditary, e.g. as a result of autoinflammatory syndromes or in association with FMF (see E p. 234).\n Monoclonal Ig light-chain amyloidosis (AL), which has similar clinical features to AA, is seen in association with diseases involving B-lymphocytes\nsuch as multiple myeloma, B-cell lymphomas, and macroglobulinaemia.\n The commonest forms of 1° localized cutaneous amyloidosis (macular\nand lichenoid) are caused by the deposition of keratin filaments in the\nskin and are not associated with systemic amyloidosis (see Box 23.3).\nSystemic amyloidosis: what should I look for?\n• Smooth yellowish or rather waxy, translucent-looking, but firm,\n papules, nodules, or plaques on the face (eyelids, nasolabial folds,\n perioral), neck, or trunk (chest, flexures, periumbilical).

Onset usually within 2–10 weeks of exposure. NSF may affect\nthe lungs, heart, liver, and muscles, as well as the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Complications, such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis,\npulmonary hypertension, and/or diaphragmatic paralysis, may be fatal\n(mortality rate 30%).\n Gadolinium is deposited in affected tissues. Circulating fibrocytes may\nbe involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, and certain factors increase\nthe risk of developing NSF (see Box 23.4).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Symptoms: progressive painful tightening of skin, leading to disabling\n joint contractures. Bone pain is common.\n• Has the patient been investigated by a contrast-enhanced MRI in\n previous weeks or months?\n• Explore other causes of skin thickening (see Box 23.5). For example,\n symptoms such as itch, Raynaud phenomenon, or difficulty\n swallowing suggest systemic sclerosis, rather than NSF.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Symmetrical erythematous, oedematous, hyperpigmented patches or\n plaques most often on the lower limbs, but may affect the trunk and\n upper limbs. The face and neck are spared.\n• Papules, nodules, and/or well-demarcated indurated plaques with an\n irregular outline.\n• Woody thickening of the skin and fascia gives a cobblestone or ‘peau\n d’orange’ appearance.\n• Yellow scleral plaques, especially in patients under 45 years old.\n• Normal nail folds (unlike systemic sclerosis).\n• Flexion contractures of joints in association with skin thickening.\nWhat should I do?\n• Take a deep elliptical skin biopsy, looking for fibrosis, dermal\n fibroblast-like cells (CD34positive), thickening of collagen, and increased\n elastic and mucin.\n• Consider a muscle biopsy.\n• Exclude other causes of skin thickening (see Box 23.5):\n • FBC (no eosinophilia), and anti-Scl-70 and anti-centromere\n antibodies (absent). ANA may be positive in NSF and is not a helpful\n discriminator; paraproteins absent; thyroid antibodies absent.\n• Echocardiogram, CXR, lung function to exclude systemic disease.\n• For treatment, see Box 23.6.

    "text": "Skin cancer in renal transplant\nrecipients\n Skin cancer, lymphoma/lymphoproliferative malignancies, and solid\norgan tumours are common in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and\nare a leading cause of death. By 5 years after transplantation, the risk\nof developing an SCC is 7100 times greater than in an immunocompetent patient. Most patients have multiple cancers. Pathogenesis of skin\ncancer is multifactorial (see Box 23.7). Risk relates to the level, as well\nas chronicity, of immunosuppression, e.g. patients who receive ciclosporin, prednisolone, and azathioprine have a three times higher risk of\nSCC than those taking prednisolone and azathioprine alone. Switch of\nimmunosuppressant drugs to mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus may\nreduce the risk of future cancers but risk compromising graft function.\n T-regulatory (Treg) cells (a subset of T-lymphocytes) suppress\nimmune responses (facilitating cancer development) and inhibit graft\nrejection. There is now strong evidence for a potentially causal relationship between Treg cell numbers and cancer incidence in RTRs.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Photodamage: telangiectasia, solar elastosis, erythema, pigmentation.\n Common in fair-skinned individuals who are at greatest risk of skin\n cancer (see E Box 3.1, p. 43).\n• Persistent HPV-induced warts and pre-cancers, e.g. Bowen disease,\n solar keratoses on sun-exposed skin. Large numbers of seborrhoeic\n warts are linked to an increased risk of skin cancer.\n• New warty papules or tender keratotic nodules on sun-exposed\n skin: SCCs are the commonest skin cancer (65- to 250-fold increase\n in risk) and may resemble viral warts. SCCs are significantly\n commoner in immunosuppressed patients than BCCs, a reversal of\n the usual ratio of three BCCs to one SCC. RTRs with SCC are at\n increased risk of developing internal malignancies.\n• Other skin cancers include BCC (10- to 16-fold increase), malignant\n melanoma (3- to 8-fold increase), KS (84-fold increase, HHV-8related), and Merkel cell cancer (polyomavirus-related).\n• Non-melanoma skin cancers are commoner in fair-skinned individuals\n living in tropical or subtropical countries.\n• Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (mostly B-cell/EBVrelated) rarely present in skin with erythematous patches or nodules.",

In Africa, one of every three children is underweight.\nMalnutrition contributes to more than 1/2 of the nearly 12 million deaths\namong the under-5s in developing countries each year.\n In the developed world, patients who are seriously ill, are unable to care\nfor themselves, or have problems, such as malabsorption, chronic alcoholism, chronic diarrhoea, or bowel fistulae, may also be malnourished. Some\npatients choose to restrict their diets, perhaps because of religious beliefs,\nconcerns about food allergy, or eating disorders. Parents of children with\natopic eczema may omit essential nutrients, such as milk, from the child’s\ndiet in the well-intentioned, but mistaken, belief that this may cure the\neczema. Bariatric surgery, used to restrict the stomach’s capacity in obesity,\nmay cause nutritional deficiency. Rarely, genetic or metabolic defects cause\nnutritional deficiency (see E cystic fibrosis in Box 24.6).\n Cutaneous signs depend on the deficiency—protein, carbohydrate,\nvitamins, minerals, and/or essential trace elements. Some patients have\na number of deficiencies.\nCutaneous signs in malabsorption\nIncreased faecal excretion of fat is associated with variable deficiency\nin proteins, minerals, trace elements, fat-soluble vitamins, and carbohydrates, as well as water. Look for combinations of:\n• Itching, dry skin which may be very scaly (ichthyotic).\n• Hyperpigmentation (chloasma-like facial, generalized Addisonian, or\n pellagra-like; see E p. 513).\n• Pallor (iron deficiency and anaemia).\n• Brittle nails and hair loss.\n• Scaly follicular papules (phrynoderma = toad skin). Mainly extensor\n surfaces of extremities (lack of vitamin A and other nutrients).\n• Bruising, petechiae, oral bleeding (lack of vitamin K).\n• Angular stomatitis, cheilitis, glossitis (smooth, sore, red tongue),\n mucosal erosions (lack of vitamin B complex or folic acid).\n• Seborrhoeic dermatitis-like rash (lack of vitamin B complex).\nCutaneous signs in kwashiorkor\nThis common childhood disorder, seen in developing countries, is\ncaused by protein malnutrition in the presence of reasonable calories.\nKwashiorkor develops after the child is weaned (age 1–4), when diet is\nmainly starchy vegetables. Look for:\n• Erythematous or purplish hyperkeratotic plaques with fissuring like\n ‘flaky paint’ or ‘crazy paving’.\n• Hypopigmented dry skin. Fine desquamation is common.\n• Sparse dry, brittle hair.\n• Normal dark brown hair becomes orangeish red. The flag sign—\n alternating bands of pale and dark hair—with intermittent protein\n intake.\n• Cheilitis, angular stomatitis, oral erosions, vulvovaginitis.\n S ll bd",

Usually presents 4–6 weeks after\nweaning but may develop earlier if the infant is not given breast milk,\nwhich enhances zinc absorption. Zinc deficiency has also been described\nfollowing total parenteral nutrition without zinc and in association with\nalcoholism, Crohn disease, and chronic pancreatitis.\n Zinc deficiency causes acral dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhoea, as\nwell as (in infants) failure to thrive with apathy and irritability. Look for:\n• Vesiculobullous or pustular dermatitis on hands and feet.\n• Pustular paronychia.\n• Periorificial (perioral, periorbital, and perianal) crusted papules and\n plaques which may be pustular. Differentiate from impetigo (see\n E p. 136) and necrolytic migratory erythema (see E p. 516).\n• Photophobia with blepharitis and conjunctivitis.\n• Slow hair growth, generalized alopecia, and nail dystrophy with Beau\n lines in chronic zinc deficiency.\n• Delayed healing of ulcers.\n• 2° bacterial and fungal infections.\nCutaneous signs in essential fatty acid deficiency\n• Dry leathery skin and follicular keratoses.\n• Dry hair and brittle nails.\n• Periorificial plaques resembling acrodermatitis enteropathica have\n been described, but patients may also be zinc-deficient.\nCutaneous signs in iron deficiency\nIn addition to the pallor of anaemia, iron deficiency may lead to:\n• Hair loss and itching.\nCutaneous signs in vitamin D deficiency\n• Calcinosis cutis (hard nodules) caused by 2° hyperparathyroidism.\nFurther reading",

    "text": "Coeliac disease (coeliac sprue)\nCoeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, primarily found in\nCaucasians, that is associated with IgA anti-gliadin, anti-endomysial, and\nanti-transglutaminase 2 antibodies. Genes for specific class II HLA-DQ2\nand-DQ8 confer susceptibility to coeliac disease. Presentation varies but\nmay include failure to thrive (children), delayed puberty, chronic diarrhoea, and abdominal distension or pain. Malabsorption leads to nutrient\nand mineral deficiencies with problems such as anaemia (folate and iron\ndeficiency), osteomalacia, or osteoporosis. Symptoms are controlled by\na gluten-free diet.\n Coeliac disease is associated with an increased prevalence of other\ndisorders, including splenic atrophy, autoimmune endocrine disorders\n(hypothyroidism, diabetes, and Addison disease), primary biliary cirrhosis, neurological disorders, and IgA deficiency (5% of patients). Patients\nhave an increased risk of intestinal lymphoma and rarely other GI cancers. The risk is reduced by a strict gluten-free diet.\n DH occurs in 10–20% of patients but is rare in children.\nWhat is dermatitis herpetiformis?\nDH is a rare IgA-mediated bullous disease that is associated with sensitivity to gluten. All patients have coeliac disease which is never severe and\nis usually subclinical. Serum IgA autoantibodies to epidermal transglutaminase 3 probably play some part in the pathogenesis (see E p. 515).\nDH may be associated with other autoimmune diseases (see Box 24.4).\n For more information, see E pp. 274–5.\n\n Box 24.4 Diseases associated with dermatitis\n herpetiformis\n • Vitiligo and alopecia areata.\n • Autoimmune thyroid disease (common), diabetes mellitus, Addison\n disease.\n • SLE, Sjögren syndrome, RA.\n • Acral petechiae, sometimes with a histology of leukocytoclastic\n vasculitis.\n • Intestinal lymphoma.",

    "text": "Pathogenesis of coeliac disease\nand dermatitis herpetiformis\n• An inflammatory response to certain proteins in wheat (gliadin, the\n alcohol-soluble component of gluten) and related proteins in rye\n and barley damages the mucosa of the small intestine, leading to\n malabsorption. Oats do not cause problems, provided they have not\n been contaminated with wheat proteins when ground in the mill.\n• Gluten peptides cross the intestinal epithelial barrier.\n• Tissue transglutaminase (transglutaminase 2) in the small bowel binds\n to, and deaminates, gliadins, producing immunogenetic peptides that\n activate a T-cell response. Antigen-presenting cells expressing the\n HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules have an increased affinity for\n these peptides.\n• Activated gluten-specific T-cells stimulate B-cell production of\n IgA anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase 2 antibodies.

    "text": "Sarcoidosis\nSarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown cause (see Box 25.1)\nthat predominantly affects the lung (90%), but may involve virtually any\norgan. African/Caribbean patients tend to have more severe manifestations. Skin is affected in 25% of patients.\nWhat should I look for?\nSpecific cutaneous lesions\nSkin is easier to biopsy to confirm the diagnosis than internal organs, so\nlook hard for skin signs. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a great imitator. Specific\ncutaneous lesions have a granulomatous histology (see E Box 33.5,\np. 651) and may include:\n• Asymptomatic translucent yellowish brown firm papules (often\n periorbital), nodules, or plaques (round, oval, or annular)\n (see Fig. 25.1) on an erythematous background. Smooth or scaly.\n May appear psoriasiform. Diascopy reveals yellow-brown colour\n (see Box 25.2). Usually resolve spontaneously.\n• Changing scars: infiltration gives skin a purplish red colour\n (see Fig. 25.2). May be tender. Sarcoid may also involve tattoos.\n• Firm subcutaneous nodules (Darier–Roussy sarcoid) most often on\n the forearms. Often associated with systemic disease.\n• Lupus pernio: indolent reddish purple destructive plaques and\n nodules on the nose, cheeks, lips, and ears (sites where skin is\n cool). Commonest in women. Lesions may ulcerate and heal with\n telangiectatic scars (see Fig. 25.3). Poor prognosis. Associated with\n more severe pulmonary disease. May respond to oral lenalidomide.\n• Alopecia: scarring or non-scarring.\n• Ulcers, most often on legs: seen most often in African Americans.\n• Ichthyosis-like scaling on legs (rarely generalized).\n• Lichenoid (1–2%): violaceous or yellow/brown scaly papules on the\n face, trunk, and limbs. Histology: both granulomas and focal basal cell\n degeneration.\n• Hypopigmented macules or patches, or hypopigmentation over\n papules.\n• Nail involvement: nail plate dystrophy, including pitting, longitudinal\n ridging, opacity, and loss of nail plate. Periungual changes are unusual.\n• Coarse trabecular bony changes in the distal phalanx are rare.\nNon-specific cutaneous lesions\n• Erythema nodosum is a ‘reactive’ panniculitis, which tends to\n be associated with an acute form of sarcoid. It resolves without\n treatment.

Some aspects of chronic GVHD share features with other\nautoimmune diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, bronchiolitis\nobliterans, and Sjögren syndrome.\n Patients should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team that includes\nophthalmologists, dermatologists, and haematologists. Fifty percent\nhave limited cutaneous disease and a good prognosis, but the outcome in\nwidespread chronic cutaneous GVHD is poor (see Box 26.6).\nWhat should I look for?\n• Manifestations vary, and patients often have overlapping patterns of\n disease with a combination of lichenoid and sclerodermoid features.\n• Check hair and nails, as well as skin (see Box 26.4).\n• Examine mucosae, including genitalia (see Box 26.5).\n• Assess joint mobility and impact of disease.\n• 0 These patients have been exposed to chemotherapy and\n prolonged immunosuppression and are at risk of cutaneous\n malignancies and/or unusual cutaneous infections (fungal, atypical\n mycobacterial).\n• Other organ involvement includes:\n • GIT causing abdominal symptoms (diarrhoea) and weight loss.\n • Liver with abnormal LFTs.\n • Lungs causing shortness of breath (check lung function tests).\nWhat should I do?\n• Biopsy atypical cutaneous lesions to exclude malignancy/infection.\n• Emollients and soap substitutes with antiseptics may reduce itch,\n improve the skin barrier, and reduce the risk of infection.\n• Artificial saliva, topical local anaesthetic gels, and topical corticosteroids\n are indicated for painful oral disease (see E Box 14.4, p. 283).\n• Prescribe artificial tears for dry eyes.\n• Lichenoid disease: potent corticosteroid ointments or 0.1%\n tacrolimus ointment bd may reduce inflammation.\n• Sclerodermoid disease: UVB, PUVA, or UVA1 may be helpful in early\n disease.

The syndrome most often\n follows trigeminal ablation by rhizotomy or alcohol injection into\n the Gasserian ganglion, but may be triggered by other causes of\n damage to the trigeminal nerve or its central connections such\n as cerebrovascular accidents, acoustic neuromas, syringobulbia,\n herpes zoster, or trauma.\n • Irritating paraesthesiae or dysaesthesiae in the affected dermatome\n or a sensation of nasal congestion provoke compulsive selfmutilation. Picking and rubbing lead to ulceration.\n • Patients may not be aware of their actions.\n • Typically, ulcers involve the ala nasi, sometimes spreading to the\n adjacent lip and cheek. The scalp, forehead, ear, palate, or jaw may\n be affected.\n • The tip of the nose (anterior ethmoidal nerve) and angle of the jaw\n (greater auricular nerve) are spared.\n • Differential diagnosis includes infection (herpes simplex and\n zoster, deep fungal, syphilis, yaws, TB, leprosy), malignancy (BCC,\n SCC, lymphoma), vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis),\n and pyoderma gangrenosum.\n • Biopsy shows non-specific inflammation.\n • Management is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary approach.\n • Educate the patient, and protect the skin with occlusive dressings.\n Carbamazepine, diazepam, and amitriptyline are of limited help.\n Surgical repair with a skin flap has been recommended.\n\nFurther reading\nH ij k JG t l N t R N l 2012 8 369 79 ( ll fib thi )",

Numbers increase\n in childhood. Spots in prepubertal children >5mm in diameter, but\n post-puberty >15mm. Usually have smooth outlines, but larger ones\n may be irregular. Intensity of colour varies, but most are pale brown.\n Fade in adulthood.\n• Axillary or inguinal freckles, 1–3mm in diameter, develop later than\n café au lait spots. Freckling may also appear around the neck and in\n other skinfolds (for other causes of freckling, see E p. 613).\n• Two or more neurofibromas of any type, or one or more plexiform\n neurofibroma. Dermal neurofibromas also appear later than café\n au lait spots. Large numbers only develop in adulthood. They may\n occur at any skin site but usually spare exposed skin (e.g. face),\n except in severe cases (see Fig. 27.1). Apply gentle pressure to small\n neurofibromas, and they sink down into the skin, ‘buttonholing’—a\n virtually pathognomonic sign. Neurofibromas are soft and may\n become pedunculated. Patients may develop thousands of disfiguring\n neurofibromas. subcutaneous neurofibromas may involve major\n peripheral nerves or nerve roots. Plexiform neurofibromas (usually\n congenital) track along nerves or infiltrate subcutaneous tissues,\n and are associated with local hypertrophy of bone and soft tissues.\n Overlying skin may be hyperpigmented, with increased hair growth\n (hypertrichosis).\n• An optic pathway glioma.\n• Two or more Lisch nodules (melanocytic hamartomas of the iris). The\n yellowish-brown nodules within the iris appear before neurofibromas\n and will confirm the diagnosis. They are easier to see with a slit-lamp\n than with the naked eye, so refer to an ophthalmologist.\n• Sphenoid wing dysplasia or thinning of the cortex of long bones, with\n or without pseudarthrosis.\n• First-degree relative with NF1 diagnosed by the presence of two or\n more of the above criteria.\nFurther reading\nBoyd KP et al.

    "text": "Other neurofibromatoses\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 2\nNeurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare condition inherited as an AD\ndisorder (incidence about 1 in 40000). The NF2 tumour suppressor\ngene encodes the FERM domain protein (Merlin), which promotes the\nformation of intercellular contacts and regulates cell proliferation. The\ndiagnosis is confirmed, if the individual has bilateral vestibular schwannomas or a family history of NF2 in a first-degree relative plus a unilateral\nvestibular schwannoma diagnosed by age 30 or any two of: meningioma,\nglioma, schwannoma, juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities/\njuvenile cataracts.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Café au lait spots: rarely >5, so do not meet criteria for NF1.\n• Peripheral nerve tumours: less frequent than in NF1. Most often small\n (<2cm) discrete plaques with a rough surface (may be pigmented\n or hypertrichotic) or subcutaneous schwannomas. Dermal\n neurofibroma-like tumours are uncommon and few in number.\nSegmental neurofibromatosis 1\nPatients mosaic for a somatic mutation in the NF1 gene have features of\nNF1 limited to one or a few body segments. Children may present with\nunilateral lentigines in the axilla or groin or a group of café au lait spots\nanywhere on the body.\n The clinical features are determined by the timing of the mutation during the development of the embryo, but it is unusual to see both neurofibromas and café au lait spots. The segmental bands of neurofibromas\nprobably follow the dermatomes (see Fig. 27.1), but pigmentary changes\nare more likely to follow the lines of Blaschko (see E p. 63).\n Such patients rarely experience the complications found in generalized NF1 but should be advised about the low risk of having a child with\ngeneralized NF1.",

Ten to\n20% of children with infantile spasms have tuberous sclerosis.\n Two-thirds of cases are sporadic mutations. One of two tumour suppressor genes is involved in the pathogenesis of the hamartomas that are\nthe hallmark of the disease. Mutations in TSC1 (protein product hamartin) or TSC2 (protein product tuberin) lead to upregulation of the mTOR\npathway with uncontrolled cell growth. mTOR inhibitors, e.g. sirolimus\nor everolimus, may be helpful. Cutaneous signs, especially hypopigmented macules, may be of considerable help in making the diagnosis,\nparticularly in children.\nWhat mucocutaneous signs should I look for?\n• Hypopigmented macules on the trunk and limbs. May be present at\n birth. Few or scattered widely in a confetti-like pattern. Hair within\n macules is hypopigmented (look for white streak in scalp hair). Ash\n leaf patch is a misnomer, as macules may be any shape. Cutaneous\n hypopigmentation is accentuated by examination of the skin under\n Wood light. But remember other causes of hypopigmentation,\n particularly post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (see Box 27.7).\n• Forehead plaques (may be present at birth) on the scalp, face, or\n neck. Initially resemble capillary haemangiomas but evolve into firm,\n red, or yellowish brown plaques, with a histology of angiofibromas.\n• Facial angiofibromas (‘adenoma sebaceum’) on nasolabial folds and\n cheeks. The erythematous papules and/or nodules appear in 85%\n of individuals after age 5 and slowly increase in number. Associated\n with telangiectasia. Often misdiagnosed as acne or rosacea—but no\n pustules (see E p. 254). May respond to topical mTOR inhibitors.\n• Shagreen patch (connective tissue naevus with increased collagen).\n Rare in infancy, but usually appear in adolescence. The orange-red\n patches develop most often on the lower back or thigh, varying in\n size from a few mm to 15cm. Dermal thickening may give the skin the\n feel of soft rubber. Surface may be dimpled like orange peel or slightly\n rough (resembles untanned leather or pig skin). Small ‘gooseflesh’\n bumps may surround a larger central patch.\n• Periungual fibromas (garlic clove tumours). Check toes, as well as\n fingers. The small, smooth, fleshy tumours arise from beneath the nail\n fold and may press down on the nail plate to produce a longitudinal\n groove. A single fibroma may occur in a normal individual (see\n Fig. 27.2).\n• Skin tags around the neck: molluscum fibrosum pendulum.\n• Subcutaneous occipital angiofibromas.",

Management is challenging (see Box 28.1,\n and E Box 10.5, p. 223).\n• Acne excoriée (compulsive picking of mild acne lesions\n (see E pp. 242–3). A form of psychogenic pruritus.

Patients attribute their personal failings at work or social difficulties to the ‘defect’ and may be tempted to\nspend large sums of money in an attempt to alleviate the ‘problem’. Some\nyoung women devastated by what they perceive to be ‘severe’ acne may\ndemand repeated courses of isotretinoin.\nWhat should I do?\n• Avoid doing anything that might produce changes such as redness,\n scars, or pigment that will cause even more dissatisfaction. Cosmetic\n surgery is unlikely to satisfy the patient.\n• Encourage the patient to see a psychologist or psychiatrist for mental\n health assessment, especially if considering cosmetic surgery.\n• Sadly, these patients are rarely satisfied with any treatment, have little\n psychological insight, and are most unlikely to accept that nothing\n is wrong.\nDelusional infestation\nSynonym: delusional parasitosis\n Patients hold a fixed, but false, belief that they are infected with living pathogens, e.g. parasites, bacteria, mites, worms, or insects, as well\nas inanimate materials, e.g. fibres, crystals, needles, or ‘Morgellons’ (an\nInternet-induced disease). Delusions may be shared by one or more\nfamily members or close friends. The delusion may follow a real infestation or be linked to recreational drug abuse, dementia, or an underlying\norganic disease, but commonly no cause is found.\n The patient will demonstrate skin signs (caused by scratching or picking) and describe how pathogens, e.g. ‘insects’ or ‘threads’, have been\nextracted from the skin. You are likely to be presented with a ‘specimen\nsign’—a small container containing carefully collected ‘proof’ of infestation, e.g. particles of skin, hair, cloth, or plant.\nWhat should I do?\n• Search for true infestation, and study all specimens thoroughly to\n reassure the patient and establish trust.\n• Acknowledge and discuss the ‘skin sensations’.\n• Exclude other causes of thought disorders or formication (crawling\n sensations), including abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs such as\n cocaine or amphetamine.

Mechanical trauma and chemicals,\nsuch as nicotine, also alter skin. Changes are cumulative. Compare the\nappearance of sun-protected intrinsically aged skin on a covered site,\nsuch as the buttock, with exposed extrinsically aged, photodamaged skin\n(face, forearm, back of the hand).\nIntrinsic ageing\n• Abnormal epidermal barrier function and abnormal lipids lead to\n increased permeability and water loss with dryness and fissuring.\n• Variable epidermal thickness with loss of rete ridges reduces\n epidermal adhesion and predisposes to blistering.\n• Loss and fragmentation of dermal collagen fibrils and degenerate\n elastin result in thin weak skin, inelasticity, and fine wrinkles (see\n Box 29.1).\n• Fewer active melanocytes impair photoprotection.\n• Fifty percent decrease in Langerhans cells impairs cell-mediated\n immunity.\n• Age-related alterations in dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) may\n provide a microenvironment that supports the development of skin\n cancers.\n• Reduced dermal microvasculature and changes in ECM contribute to\n delayed wound healing.\n• Benign neoplasia, e.g. cherry angiomas, seborrhoeic warts.\nPhotoageing\nUVR accelerates the intrinsic ageing process, including the accumulation of fragmented connective tissue fibres (collagen and elastin), and\nis responsible for many of the signs we associate with old age, including\ndeep wrinkles, leathery appearance, purpura, and dyspigmentation (see\nE Box 3.1, p. 43; and Box 29.1).\nFurther reading\nFisher GJ et al.

    "text": "Dry itchy skin and asteatotic eczema\nMost older people have dry itchy skin (xerosis) that is easily irritated.\nSymptoms often deteriorate after admission to hospital, because the\nskin is dried out by enthusiastic washing with soap, a low humidity, and\ncentral heating. Some patients with very dry skin develop asteatotic\neczema. Itch may be distressing, interfering with sleep and significantly\nimpacting on quality of life (see E Fig. 10.2, p. 220).\nWhat should I ask?\n• Find out precisely what the patient or carer is using to wash the skin\n or is putting in the bath.\n• Is the patient putting anything on the skin? Check precisely how any\n treatments have been used (see E pp. 30–1).\n• Take a full history, including a drug history (see E pp. 18–21).\n• Is anyone else itchy? Remember the old lady with ‘a rash’ who is in\n the same nursing home, the spouse with ‘hand dermatitis’, or the\n grandchild with ‘eczema’ may well have scabies.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Dry, slightly scaly skin.\n• Asteatotic eczema: the skin is very dry and has a network of shallow\n erythematous fissures in the epidermis that produce an appearance\n that resembles ‘crazy paving’ (eczema craquelé). Asteatotic eczema\n usually starts on the shins but may spread in a patchy fashion to the\n thighs and trunk. Intensity of itch varies (see E Fig. 10.2, p. 220).\n• Some very itchy patients may have 2° changes such as excoriations\n or nodules (prurigo nodularis) where the skin is being scratched (the\n centre of the back is usually spared) (see E p. 222, and Fig. 10.6,\n p. 223).\n• Look for evidence of an infestation such as scabies (burrows or\n crusting between the fingers). Older patients with scabies may have\n a widespread crusted scaly rash—Norwegian scabies (see E p. 172\n and Box 8.1, p. 173).\n• Signs of another skin disease, e.g. bullous pemphigoid, an\n autoimmune blistering disease that commonly presents in older\n people. Itchy, erythematous, ‘urticated’ papules may appear months\n before the tense blisters (pre-pemphigoid) (see E p. 270).\nWhat should I do?\n• Investigate to exclude a systemic cause for the itch (see Box 29.4).\n• Soap substitutes and emollients should be sufficient to settle the\n irritation in most patients with dry skin (see E p. 655 and Box 29.5).\n• Prescribe a mild or moderately potent topical corticosteroid\n ointment to use bd on inflamed skin (see E p. 656).\n• If the itch persists, despite these measures, check the treatment is\n being used correctly (is the skin still dry?); look for scabies again, and\n re-evaluate for a systemic disease, before considering the possibility\n of a psychogenic component to the itch (see E Box 28.1, p. 567).",

    "text": "Skin in pregnancy\nThe changes in skin and hair that occur during pregnancy are linked to the\nphysiological hormonal changes during gestation, including:\n• Synthesis of human chorionic gonadotrophin (peaks at week 12).\n• Production of progesterone and oestrogen from the corpus luteum.\n• Alterations in thyroid function and increased output of\n gonadotrophins and ACTH.\nWhat skin signs should I look for?\n• Hyperpigmentation: more marked in women with dark hair. Some\n pigment tends to persist post-partum in dark-skinned women.\n • Nipples, areolae, axillae, vulva, perianal, and scars.\n • Abdomen: a central line of pigmentation (linea nigra) that is usually\n most marked below the umbilicus but may extend higher.\n • Face: the ‘mask of pregnancy’ (melasma) (see Box 30.1).\n • Increased numbers of melanocytic naevi (moles) and darkening or\n enlargement of pre-existing melanocytic naevi and freckles\n (see Box 30.4).\n • Generalized hyperpigmentation (less common than focal).\n• Vascular: increased vascular permeability and proliferation:\n • Palmar erythema.\n • Cutis marmorata, purpura, and petechiae affecting the legs.\n • Spider naevi predominantly in areas drained by the superior\n vena cava (face, neck, arms, and hands). Capillary haemangiomas\n usually on the head and neck.

Consider:\n• Atopic eruption of pregnancy (common). Starts earlier than\n other specific dermatoses (before third trimester). The scaly,\n erythematous, eczematous rash is often flexural. Some patients also\n have prurigo or follicular papules. Commonly recurs in subsequent\n pregnancies.\n• Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy. Starts late in pregnancy or\n immediately post-partum. Smooth, erythematous, ‘urticated’\n papules and plaques (like wheals, but do not come and go) appear in\n abdominal striae. Spares the periumbilical skin. May exhibit Koebner\n phenomenon (rash in scars). Occasional vesicles, usually associated\n with scratching. Rash spreads to buttocks/proximal thighs and distal\n sites.

Apply the ABCDE\n rule—any suspicious changing or new melanocytic naevus should\n be excised (see E p. 354). Melanoma incidence is not increased\n during pregnancy. There is no effect on survival in women\n diagnosed with localized malignant melanoma (MM) during\n pregnancy (prognosis related to AJCC staging prognostic factors;\n see E Table 17.1, p. 355). Pregnancies prior or subsequent to a\n diagnosis of MM do not impact prognosis. Risk of metastasis to\n the placenta and/or fetus is extremely low and occurs exclusively\n in women with widespread metastatic disease (AJCC stage IV; see\n E Table 17.1, p. 355). There is no enhanced risk of developing MM\n associated with oral contraceptive pill use or hormone replacement\n therapy.\n Systemic lupus erythematosus\n • Increased risk of flares during pregnancy. Corticosteroids are the\n treatment of choice but do not prevent flares. Associated with\n increased risk of miscarriage, fetal loss, pre-eclampsia, preterm\n delivery, and fetal growth restriction. Anti-Ro antibodies can\n cross the placenta, with 5% risk of cutaneous neonatal LE—scaly,\n annular eruption on the face/scalp within first 2 weeks of life.\n Rash disappears spontaneously within 6 months; scarring unusual.\n Congenital heart block, detected in utero at around 16–18 weeks\n gestation, incurs a risk of perinatal mortality.

    "text": "Safety of treatments in pregnancy\nMost drugs are not studied in pregnancy, and there are little data about\nsafety of common medications in pregnancy. Congenital malformations\nmay occur during the first trimester—the greatest risk is from weeks 3\nto 11 of pregnancy. Drugs should only be prescribed, if benefits outweigh\nthe risks, but remember suboptimal treatment of the mother might also\nbe harmful to the unborn child.\nTopical medicaments\n• Antifungals: safe when used topically.\n• Corticosteroids: mild to potent topical corticosteroids are safe to use\n in pregnancy. Large amounts (>300g during entire pregnancy) of very\n potent topical corticosteroids may be linked to low birthweight.\n• Calcipotriene (topical vitamin D): no data, probably safe topically.\n• Coal tar: limited data. Avoid in first trimester.\n• Retinoids: contraindicated.\n• Tacrolimus: no data, probably safe when used topically.\nOral medicaments\n• Antibiotics: penicillins, erythromycin, clindamycin—appear safe.\n• Antivirals: aciclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir—appear safe.\n• Antihistamines: chlorphenamine—probably safe. Cetirizine appears\n safe in third trimester.\n• Antifungals: avoid itraconazole (risk of abortion).\n Terbinafine: no data.\n• Azathioprine: risks not established but may be associated with low\n birthweight or spontaneous abortion. Avoid, if possible.\n• Ciclosporin: may be associated with prematurity, growth retardation,\n or impaired immune function. Avoid, if possible.\n• Dapsone: folic acid should be given throughout pregnancy. Risk\n of neonatal haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia. May cause\n kernicterus—avoid in late pregnancy.\n• Prednisolone: 88% of prednisolone is inactivated, as it crosses the\n placenta. Short-term treatment is safe. Prolonged or repeated\n treatment may be associated with intrauterine growth restriction.\n• Methotrexate: teratogenic. Avoid in pregnancy. ♂ and ♀ should use\n effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months\n after stopping the drug. May also reduce fertility.\n• Retinoids: teratogenic. ♀ must use effective contraception during\n treatment. Acitretin: continue contraception for at least 2 years after\n withdrawing treatment.

Some have a deeper bluish component (see Fig. 31.3).\n• Growth phase: rapid for 3–4 months; slow for 6–18 months. Deep\n components grow for longer.\n• Involution. Colour slowly fades; nodules soften and shrink; 50–60%\n involute completely by age 5 years, 70–75% by age 7 years, and 90%\n by age 9 years. Residual changes may include pallor and lax skin.\n• Deeper components may persist.\n• What to do and when to worry\n• Most do not require treatment, regressing spontaneously, without\n significant sequelae. Discuss the likely outcome with the parents.\n Photographs may be useful to document evolution and resolution.\n• A minority of enlarging infantile haemangiomas need early treatment\n to prevent disfigurement or organ compromise (see Box 31.7).\n • Periocular: may obstruct vision and lead to permanent amblyopia.\n Refer for urgent visual assessment. MRI if displacement of the\n globe or thickening of the lid.\n • Mandibular or neck area: internal infantile haemangiomas may\n cause airway obstruction. If noisy breathing, stridor, or difficulty\n breathing when feeding, refer for urgent ENT assessment.\n • Lips: infantile haemangiomas may interfere with the ability to suck.\n• Ulceration in the growth phase (see Box 31.8).\n• Plaque-like facial haemangioma may be associated with PHACE\n (Posterior fossa malformations, Haemangioma, Arterial\n abnormalities, Coarctation of the aorta, and Eye abnormalities).\n Called PHACES if also Sternal clefting and/or Supraumbilical raphe.\n• Plaque-like lumbosacral haemangioma: look for tags or dimples in the\n genital and sacral areas.

    "text": "Red scaly skin in neonates and infants\nAtopic eczema (dermatitis), the commonest cause of redness and itching\nin children, does not usually present until around the age of 3 months\n(see E p. 606). Neonates with red scaly skin are much more likely to\nhave infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis, which presents in the first month\nand usually clears after 3 or 4 months.\n • Severe generalized erythema and scale (neonatal erythroderma)\nassociated with failure to thrive is rare but suggests an underlying problem (see Boxes 31.11 and 31.12). In some forms of ichthyosis, the neonate\nis born encased in a tight, smooth, shiny collodion membrane (collodion\nbaby). The tight skin causes dysmorphic features, including ectropion\n(lower eyelid turned outwards), eclabium (lip turned outwards), malformed ears, and flexion contractures. In both erythroderma and collodion babies, the barrier function of the skin is abnormal, leading to fluid\nloss, infection, poor thermoregulation, and absorption of topical agents.\nUse bland emollients, and control humidity (see E pp. 626–7).\nInfantile seborrhoeic dermatitis\nWhat should I look for?\n• A well infant, not particularly itchy (atopic eczema is very itchy).\n• A greasy, erythematous, scaly, orange-red papular rash involving the\n face, scalp (‘cradle cap’), and flexures. Look in skinfolds, particularly\n around the neck and in the napkin area (usually spared in atopic\n eczema) (see Fig. 31.6). Irritant napkin dermatitis involves convex\n surfaces and spares the skinfolds (see Box 31.12 and Fig. 31.5). Rash\n may be secondarily infected by Candida. Some infants develop tiny\n sterile pustules (see neonatal acne in Box 31.4).\nWhat should I do?\n• Explain that the condition should clear by about 4 months of age.\n• Bath with emollients to reduce scale and crust. Avoid soaps which\n may irritate the skin.\n• A mild topical corticosteroid combined with an antifungal bd will\n reduce redness. Avoid more potent corticosteroids.\n• Remove scalp scale with olive oil or an emollient such as Hydromol®\n ointment.\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis\nThis rare disease may be misdiagnosed as infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis. • Purpura and ulceration should alert you to ‘something different’.\nA skin biopsy will confirm the diagnosis. Look for:\n• Erythematous pink or brown, scaly, crusted papules on the trunk, in\n the napkin area, and in flexures that may become confluent.\n• Purpuric papules that may ulcerate and weep.\n• Scaling and crusting on the scalp. The scalp bleeds, when scale is\n removed (a useful sign).\n• Fever (sometimes).\n• Isolated skin involvement may regress spontaneously, but refer for\n assessment and treatment",

    "text": "Napkin rashes\nAtopic eczema, the commonest form of dermatitis in infancy, tends to\nspare the moist skin in the napkin area. Instead, most napkin rashes are\ncaused by urine and/or faeces irritating macerated skin (irritant contact\ndermatitis). Prevalence has fallen, because highly absorbent nappies wick\nmoisture away from the skin.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Irritant dermatitis occurs between the ages of 3 weeks and 2 years.\n The rash involves the convex surfaces (e.g. buttocks) in contact with\n the napkin and spares skinfolds. The erythematous skin may have a\n rather glazed shiny appearance (see Fig. 31.5). Severe chronic irritant\n dermatitis may be associated with well-demarcated erosions (Jacquet\n dermatitis) or extensive papules.\n• Candida napkin dermatitis, in infants aged 6–24 months, starts in\n skinfolds but may extend to involve the entire perineum. Look for\n satellite papules (less often pustules) and oral candidiasis.\n• Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis is an asymptomatic rash that\n usually presents around age 4–6 weeks. Look for well-demarcated\n erythematous patches, without much scale, in skinfolds. Inspect the\n scalp, face, and axillae (see E p. 602 and Fig. 31.6). May be difficult to\n differentiate from napkin psoriasis (see Box 31.13).\n• Allergy to preservatives in wet wipes may present as dermatitis.\n• Erosive perianal eruption is caused by diarrhoea, often in breastfed\n infants aged 6 weeks to 3 months. The rash is characterized by\n erythema, with well-demarcated superficial erosions.\n• Staphylococcal impetigo may present with flaccid bullae in the napkin\n area, often in the first few weeks of life.\n• Group A streptococcal dermatitis (infants, >6 months) causes painful\n perianal erythema (may involve inguinal folds) (see E p. 132).\nWhat should I do?\n• Culture skin swabs for Candida and bacteria.\n• Minimize irritation of the skin:\n • Wash skin with plain water and a soap substitute.\n • Ensure that baby wipes are alcohol- and fragrance-free.\n • Change the napkin, as soon as it is soiled by faeces.\n • Avoid talcum powders which may irritate the skin.\n• Paraffin-based ointments, such as Hydromol® or 50% WSP in liquid\n paraffin, hydrate the skin and act as a barrier to external irritants.\n• Treat inflamed skin with twice-daily applications of an ointment\n containing 1% hydrocortisone, in combination with an antifungal agent\n such as miconazole or clotrimazole.\n• Treat bacterial infection with oral antibiotics.\n• Rashes unresponsive to treatment: think again (see Box 31.13).\nFurther reading\nStamatas GN and Tierney NK.

Napkin psoriasis tends to start on the convex surfaces of\n the buttocks but may spread to the flexures, trunk, face, and\n scalp. Most infants do not have evidence of psoriasis in nails. Any\n family history of psoriasis? The rash is difficult to differentiate from\n infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis, but seborrhoeic dermatitis is\n usually controlled after 2–4 weeks of treatment. Aim to keep the\n skin comfortable using emollients and mild topical corticosteroids,\n rather than clear psoriasis.\n • Dermatophyte infection (‘ringworm’) presents with welldemarcated scaly, erythematous papules and plaques, usually in\n toddlers, rather than infants. Sometimes there are pustules. Often\n involves the thighs and lower abdomen, as well as the napkin area.\n Has anyone in the family got tinea pedis? Take a skin scrape for\n mycology (see E p. 164).\n • Blisters or erosions? SSSS, caused by a circulating exfoliative\n exotoxin, presents with a tender peeling erythema, sometimes\n limited to the napkin area (see E p. 112). Allergic contact\n dermatitis is uncommon in infants but may present as a vesicular\n eruption in infants aged >6 months. Rarely, autoimmune blistering\n diseases may present in the napkin area in infancy.\n • Purpura or ulceration? Langerhans cell histiocytosis involves the\n flexures and the napkin area, but may also affect the scalp, the skin\n behind the ears, and the trunk (see E p. 602).\n • Zinc deficiency presents with psoriasiform dermatitis around the\n mouth, as well as in the napkin area.

    "text": "Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis)\nAtopic eczema is a chronic itchy skin condition that affects 20–25% of\nchildren in Western Europe. Prevalence is increasing. Atopic eczema\nusually starts in infancy. Most have mild disease. Disease clears in about\n50% of children by puberty. Others have a chronic and recurrent lifelong\nillness. Pathogenesis is multifactorial (see Box 31.14). The prevalences of\nbronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis are increased in atopic patients, and\nskin-prick tests are positive to many common environmental allergens.\nWhat should I ask?\nExplore:\n• Age of onset (usually age 2–3 months) and distribution of eczema.\n• Response to previous and current treatments.\n• Impact on the child and family/carers (especially on sleep).\n• Growth, development, and progress at nursery/school.\n• Dietary history, including any dietary manipulation.\n• Immediate reactions (urticaria, wheeze, angio-oedema) to foods.\n• Exposure to trigger factors, including heat and irritants such as wool\n clothing, soaps, shampoos, bubble baths, and shower gels. Allergic\n dermatitis is unusual in children, but irritant reactions to creams are\n common.\n• Contact with airborne allergens such as house dust mite and pet\n dander (more important in older infants/children).\n• Personal and family history of atopy (e.g. asthma, allergic rhinitis).\nWhat should I do?\n• Confirm the diagnosis: usually clear-cut, but remember scabies in any\n itchy child. For diagnostic criteria, see Box 31.15, and Figs. 31.7, 31.8,\n and 31.9).\n• Make a global assessment: mild, moderate, or severe—based on\n symptoms (such as itching and sleep disturbance); the quantities or\n strengths of treatment, clinical signs, and the area affected.\n• Record impact on quality of life of the child/family (see E pp. 32–4).\n• Using ‘POEM’ (patient-orientated eczema measure), get the patient’s\n view (see M www.nottingham.ac.uk/dermatology/POEM.htm).\n• Scores, such as EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) or SCORAD\n (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), will help to monitor response to\n treatment objectively.\n• Crusted weeping eczema or pustules: swab for bacterial culture.\n• Pain, grouped vesicles or small well-defined crusted erosions: exclude\n herpes simplex infection (eczema herpeticum), a medical emergency\n (see E Box 7.2, p. 154).\n• Immediate reactions to foods: refer for further investigation, if\n clinically indicated (see Box 31.18).\n• Refer for patch testing, if you suspect allergic contact dermatitis, but\n irritancy is much commoner than allergy.\n• Approaches to management, including top tips, are discussed\n on E pp. 608–9 and pp. 610–11.",

    "text": "Managing atopic eczema: top tips\nLiving with and managing atopic eczema is challenging for child and family. The psychosocial burden can be profound. Aim to address concerns\nand to educate (see Box 31.16), so that the child /family have the tools to\nmanage this distressing chronic disease.\n• Intractable itch/scratch. Relieve dryness, and control eczema.\n Protect skin from damage—suggest stroking or pinching skin to\n relieve itch; use occlusion. Therapeutic stories, in which the child is\n champion, may facilitate behavioural change, improve self-esteem,\n and help the child engage with treatment (overcoming ‘Evil Eric\n Eczema’).\n• Complaints that the skin ‘reacts to’/‘is allergic to’ emollients.\n Irritation of inflamed skin is much commoner than allergy. Ointments\n may be tolerated less well than creams. Suggest trying a creamy\n emollient on normal skin for a few days, before applying to\n eczematous skin. Explain that, if normal skin does not react, allergy\n is unlikely. Control acute eczema with topical corticosteroids or\n calcineurin inhibitors, and then apply emollients.\n• Steroid phobia. Some parents refuse to use ‘bad’ topical steroids\n (a misconception that may have been reinforced by other healthcare professionals). Explain the different strengths of steroids and\n the proper use of topical steroids (see E p. 610). State the specific\n quantity of topical corticosteroid you expect to be used over 1 or\n 2 weeks.\n• Once eczema is controlled, empower the child and family by\n introducing proactive therapy, i.e. low-dose, intermittent applications\n of anti-inflammatory therapy to previously affected skin (‘hot spots’)\n (see Box 31.17).\n• ‘He has a food allergy’. Find out exactly what the parent means and\n what has been observed (see Box 31.18). Inappropriate withdrawal\n of foods may cause nutritional deficiencies. Most children with mild\n eczema do not need investigation for food allergies.\n• Recurrent 2° bacterial infection (oozing golden-crusted patches),\n usually with S. aureus. Use antibacterial emollients, e.g. products\n containing benzalkonium chloride and/or chlorhexidine, to cleanse\n the skin and remove crusts. Bleach baths (1/4 cup of household\n bleach in a half bathtub of water) for 5–10min, 2–3x/week may\n reduce bacterial colonization. Treat nasal carriage of S. aureus (child\n and family) with topical mupiricin. Short courses of oral antibiotics\n may be required.\n• Molluscum contagiosum. May be spread by scratching. Reassure the\n child/parent that molluscum will go, but this may take some time,\n particularly if topical steroids are being used. Flares of eczema around\n molluscum may herald regression. (Also see E p. 158.)\n• Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Caring for children\n with eczema is exhausting. Some are just itchy and active, but others,\n in particular those with more severe eczema, may have ADHD.\n Consider referral to a child psychologist.",

Education is crucial, and the help of\n a dermatology nurse invaluable.\n • Explore beliefs, fears, preferences, and hopes.\n • Identify barriers to adherence, e.g. steroid phobia, time for\n treatment, complexity of regimen, cost, and discomfort.\n • Agree educational objectives, e.g. proper use of topical steroids.\n • Implement a written action plan.\n\n Box 31.17 Proactive therapy for atopic eczema\n Normal-looking non-lesional skin in patients is not normal—there is\n subclinical inflammation, as well as a barrier defect. Proactive therapy\n targets invisible inflammation in problem areas and reduces overall use\n of topical anti-inflammatory therapy.\n • After clearance of visible eczema, continue to apply antiinflammatory therapy, e.g. a potent topical corticosteroid ointment\n or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment, to previously affected skin (hot spots\n or problem areas) x2/week.\n • Continue daily application of emollients to all skin.\n\n Box 31.18 Food allergy\n • Consider food allergy in children with atopic eczema who have\n reacted previously to a food with immediate symptoms (e.g.\n urticaria, wheeze, angio-oedema), or in infants and young children\n with moderate or severe atopic eczema that has not been\n controlled by optimum management, particularly if associated with\n gut dysmotility (colic, vomiting, altered bowel habit) or failure to\n thrive.

Supply a range of\n unperfumed emollients. The best emollient is the one the patient\n likes. Creamy emollients, rather than ointments, may be preferred\n for daytime use. Prescribe in large quantities (>500g/week) to be\n used liberally and frequently (see E p. 655).\n• Use an emollient as a soap substitute.\n• Reduce bacterial colonization with antibacterial emollients,\n e.g. products containing benzalkonium chloride and/or chlorhexidine\n or bleach baths (see E p. 608).\nStep 3: Topical anti-inflammatories and other treatments\n• Discuss and demonstrate the use of topical corticosteroids. Explain\n that topical corticosteroids, unlike emollients, should only be applied\n to eczematous skin. (Apply 20–30min after emollient.) Explain how\n to step up and step down the strength of treatment. Show how to\n measure the application in fingertip units (FTUs) (see E Box 34.3,\n p. 658).\n• Most mild infantile atopic eczema can be controlled with mild to\n moderate corticosteroid ointments used once daily. Ointments are\n preferable to creams, as they are less likely to irritate the skin. Mild\n corticosteroid ointments can be used safely on the face.\n• Potent topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors may be\n needed x1/day for 7–14 days for more active disease.\n• Very potent corticosteroid ointments should not be prescribed,\n without the guidance of a specialist.\n• Once eczema is controlled, switch to proactive therapy\n (see Box 31.17).\n• Wraps or paste bandages can help children with very itchy skin\n (see E p. 660, and Box 34.4, p. 661).\n• Treat 2° bacterial infection with antibiotics.\n• Treatments, such as UVB, methotrexate, azathioprine, or ciclosporin,\n may be indicated in severe chronic atopic eczema.\n• Prednisolone should be avoided except for acute severe flares",

Look for:\n • Many bruises of different ages, often in clusters.\n • Pinch marks on the ear or petechiae on the pinna.\n • Linear slap marks, belt marks, finger impressions, or buckle marks.\n • Cigarette burns to the face or hands, or burns to the lower limbs\n (child held forcibly in scalding water).\n• Sexual abuse:\n • Pregnancy.\n • HIV infection or another sexually transmitted disease in the absence\n of perinatal acquisition. Anogenital warts in children may be acquired\n by autoinnoculation, but the possibility of sexual abuse should be\n considered, particularly in children <2 years (see E p. 160).\n • Signs of acute penetrating anogenital trauma, including acute\n hymenal injury, laceration, bruising, or perianal lacerations.\n • Genital abrasions, lacerations, bites, suction marks, or burns.\nDermatological conditions that may simulate abuse\n• Mongolian blue spots (present at birth or soon after) may simulate\n bruises (see E p. 344 and Fig. 31.10), as may the blue/black\n pigmentation in naevus of Ota (face) or naevus of Ito (upper trunk).\n• Bullous impetigo may simulate cigarette burns (see E Fig. 6.1, p. 130).\n• SSSS, as the name suggests, can simulate scalds (see E Fig. 6.2,p. 131).\n• Phytophotodermatitis with blistering in linear streaks may simulate\n burns, or the residual pigmented streaks may simulate linear bruising\n (see E Fig. 31.11, and Box 16.4, p. 327).\n• Angio-oedema with swelling of the face or lips may simulate an early\n bruise (see E p. 104).\n• Cutaneous vasculitis with purpura may simulate bruises (see E p. 442).\n• Group A streptococcal perineal infection with itch, pain, erythema,\n discharge, and localized bleeding may suggest sexual abuse (see E\n p. 132).\n• Lichen sclerosus with haemorrhage may suggest sexual abuse\n (see E p. 288).\n• EB (rare) with skin fragility and blistering may suggest physical injury\n ( E 624 5)",

    "text": "Genetic basis of skin diseases\nDermatogenetics is a rapidly expanding field. This chapter provides an\nintroduction to a few of the many single gene disorders affecting the skin,\nhair, and/or nails—the genodermatoses.\nMonogenic disorders\nAn understanding of the molecular basis of single-gene ‘Mendelian’ skin\ndiseases has provided insights into the structure and function of normal\nskin, as well as the pathogenesis of some acquired diseases (e.g. autoimmune blistering diseases; see E Table 13.2, p. 264). For the molecular\nbasis of some monogenic skin disorders, see Table 32.1.\n A clinical disorder (phenotype) is dominant when the condition is\nmanifest in heterozygotes (two different alleles), and recessive when the\ntrait is only manifest in homozygotes (two identical alleles). AD traits\nusually involve structural proteins, whereas AR traits commonly involve\nenzymes. Generally, it is possible to predict the likelihood of disease in\nmonogenic disorders, based on analysis of the genotype, but some dominantly inherited disorders show age-dependent penetrance (features are\nnot present at birth but evolve with time), whereas others show incomplete penetrance (not all those having the mutation develop the disease).\nGenotype–phenotype correlation\nCorrelation can be difficult. Different mutations in a single gene may\ncause different clinical disorders; mutations in different genes may lead\nto similar phenotypes (genetic heterogeneity), and the same mutation\n(genotype) within a family may lead to disorders of different severity (different expressivity). In a few autosomal dominantly inherited diseases,\nseverity increases in successive generations (anticipation). Some genes\nare expressed differently, if inherited from the mother than from the\nfather (imprinting). Most X-linked traits are expressed more severely in\nmen (who are hemizygous) than in women.\nContiguous gene syndromes\nIf large deletions affect several neighbouring genes, several disorders\nmay be transmitted together, simulating a monogenic disorder.\nPolygenic disorders\nGenome-wide association studies in large populations have identified\nmany hundreds of genetic variants (markers) associated with a susceptibility to many common genetically complex diseases such as diabetes,\nautism, psoriasis, and atopic eczema, as well as to physical traits such as\nheight and pigmentation (colour of skin, hair, and eyes).\n In contrast to single-gene disorders, environmental factors and gene–\ngene interactions (epistasis) play much greater roles in determining the\nrisk of disease, so it is not possible to predict the likelihood of a complex\ndisease based solely on the genotype.",

    "text": "Mosaicism\n\nWhat is mosaicism?\nSomatic mosaicism is caused by a mutation arising early in embryogenesis that is propagated in only a limited number of cells. The outcome is\na partial phenotype, i.e. only some of the cells express the disease. In ♀,\nrandom X-inactivation (lyonization) results in functional X-chromosome\nmosaicism.\n Skin disorders reflecting mosaicism in keratinocytes follow predictable\npatterns (Blaschko lines) (see Fig. 32.1). Individuals who are mosaic for\na condition can only transmit the disorder to the next generation (who\nwill inherit the non-mosaic form), if the mosaicism also affects cells in the\ngermline (ovary, testis). Involvement of germline cells is hypothesized to\nbe more likely in individuals with extensive skin involvement. Mutations\narising early in development may be associated with widespread abnormalities in skin and other organs.\n For examples of cutaneous mosaicism, see E pp. 636–7.\nWhat are Blaschko lines?\n(see E inside back cover for diagram.)\n Alfred Blaschko was a dermatologist from Berlin who observed that\nepidermal naevi and some acquired skin diseases followed similar patterns: linear on the limbs, arcs on the chest, S-shapes on the abdomen,\nor V-shapes near the midline of the back. The patterns were not related\nto dermatomes (segments of skin defined by sensory innervations) or\nany known cause of linear skin markings such as Langer lines of cleavage,\naxial lines separating cranial and caudal dermatomes, lymphatic drainage,\nvascular flow, embryonic clefts, or pigmentary demarcation lines (see E\npp. 62–3). The lines probably reflect keratinocyte mosaicism and correspond to the pathways followed by keratinocytes migrating from the\nneural crest during embryogenesis.\nHow do I recognize cutaneous mosaicism?\nFive patterns have been described (see Fig. 32.1). The pattern is influenced by the pathway of migration of the affected cell, as well as other\nfactors such as the timing of the mutation:\n• Keratinocyte: Blaschko-linear pattern. Each clone of keratinocytes\n forms a continuous line, as the cells migrate outwards by directional\n proliferation following surface forces.\n• Melanoblast: block or phylloid but may be Blaschko-linear patterns.\n Melanoblasts migrate as single cells and proliferate locally in skin.\n• Nerve cells: dermatomal. Nerve cells migrate along future\n dermatomes.\n• Mesodermal tissues (blood vessels, fibroblasts): segmental or\n dermatomal. Cells migrate within segments or dermatomes.",

    "text": "The genetic consultation\nIf you suspect an inherited disease, discussion should be handled sensitively because of the implications for other family members, but also\nbecause of the guilt that transmission of an inherited condition can\nengender in a parent.\nWhat should I do?\n• The medical history should include details of pregnancy, labour, signs\n at birth (was the skin abnormal?), and development.\n• Take a thorough family history, ideally across at least three\n generations, including details of the youngest generations.\n• Document consanguinity—relationships between second cousins or\n closer greatly increase the risk of recessive disease.\n• Establish diagnoses as precisely as possible in other family members,\n avoiding vague terms such as ‘cancer’. Also see E Familial cancer\n syndromes, pp. 542–4.\n• Draw a family tree showing affected and unaffected individuals (see\n Figs. 32.2 and 32.3).\n• Document the physical findings in the patient—is all the skin affected,\n or are some areas spared, e.g. the flexures? Is there a pattern to the\n involvement, e.g. Blaschko lines, dermatomal? Are palms and soles\n affected? Examine the hair, nails, and teeth, as well as the skin.\n• Examine so-called ‘unaffected’ family members carefully, looking for\n subtle clinical signs.\n• Consider referring the patient and/or family to a clinical geneticist, so\n that the diagnosis can be confirmed by further investigation. Genetic\n testing will be guided by the clinical diagnosis.\nGenetic counselling\n• The help of a clinical geneticist is invaluable.\n• The diagnosis may have serious implications for family members.\n In general, it is appropriate to encourage an affected individual to\n share their personal information with members of the family (with\n the support of a geneticist).\n• Potential disclosure of genetic information to other members of a\n family raises issues of both consent and confidentiality.",

    "text": "Inherited epidermolysis bullosa\nA heterogeneous group of rare (1 in 17000 live births) genetically determined blistering disorders, which range in severity from mild to severe and\nlife-threatening. Severity and natural history vary within a single subtype or\nfamily. Sepsis, failure to thrive, or upper airway occlusion may be lethal. Many\ncausative genes/mutations have been identified. The protein defect determines the level of blistering: intra-epidermal, within the BMZ, or subepidermal (see E Table 13.1, p. 264; and Fig. 13.1, p. 261). The main groups (see Box\n32.1) encompass a number of even rarer clinical subtypes. Multidisciplinary\ncare is important, as well as access to a specialist EB team. DEBRA (UK charity) supports patients and families (M http://www.debra.org.uk/).\n Acquired EB, a rare autoimmune blistering disease, is described\non E p. 272. For more information about neonates with blisters, see\nE Box 31.4, p. 593.\nWhat should I ask or look for?\n• Sites and precipitating factors, e.g. mechanical (pressure points,\n footwear), hot weather.\n• Pain and/or itch (may be as distressing as pain).\n• Change with age—lessening of blistering?\n• Family history—is transmission likely to be AD or AR?\n• Blisters—localization and severity. Erosions—excess granulation tissue.\n• Milia, scarring, pigmentation, or eruptive naevi at sites of old blisters.\n• Keratoderma, dystrophic or absent nails; alopecia.\n• Teeth—enamel hypoplasia, caries.\n• Extracutaneous involvement, e.g. oral mucosal involvement,\n oesophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, anaemia, growth retardation.\n• Photosensitivity, poikiloderma, atrophic skin on dorsum of hands.\n• SCCs (see E p. 350).\nHow is the diagnosis confirmed?\n• Diagnosis depends on clinical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural\n findings, but accurate diagnosis may be difficult in newborns.\n• The major EB group and probable protein affected are determined\n by a combination of the phenotype, mode of transmission, and\n ultrastructural level of cleavage (IMF antigen mapping and/or\n transmission electron microscopy of a newly induced blister).\n• Mutational analysis for subclassification and genetic counselling.\nNeonates with suspected epidermolysis\nbullosa: what should I do?\n• For causes of blisters in neonates, see E Box 31.4, p. 593.

Skin loses water, and the defensive barrier to outside agents is\nreduced. Ichthyosis may improve in humid summer months, deteriorating in winter. The commoner patterns are described below (for rarer\nichthyoses, see Box 32.2). Emollients are the first-line therapy. Acquired\nichthyosis has a variety of causes, including malignancy, hypothyroidism,\ndrugs, nutritional deficiency, and neurological disease.\nIchthyosis vulgaris\n• Commonest and mildest form of ichthyosis.\n• AD transmission, mutations in gene encoding fillagrin.\n• Onset: age 6 months (not present at birth).\n• Fine, small whitish scales on extensor surfaces.\n• Spares flexures: axillae, popliteal and antecubital fossae.\n• More marked on the limbs than the trunk. Usually spares the face.\n• Marked palmar creases (hyperlinear palms).\n• Linked to atopic eczema.\nRecessive X-linked ichthyosis\n• Affects 1 in 5000 ♂.\n• Deficiency in steroid sulfatase. Low maternal oestriol (produced by\n the placenta) in the mother of the affected fetus is linked to failure to\n initiate labour or to progress labour (forceps delivery, Caesarian).\n• Onset birth to age 3 weeks as excessive neonatal desquamation.\n• Large, dark brown adherent scales over the limbs, trunk, and scalp.\n Most obvious on extensor surfaces and sides/posterior neck (‘dirty\n neck’).\n• Spares the antecubital and popliteal fossae, but affects the axillae.\n• Spares the face, apart from pre-auricular skin.\n• Palms and soles unaffected—not hyperlinear.\n• Other—corneal opacities, testicular maldescent.\n• Contiguous gene syndromes include Kallmann syndrome\n (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and anosmia).\nLamellar ichthyosis/congenital ichthyosiform\nerythroderma\n• AR congenital ichthyoses.

Severe disfiguring and disabling disease may be linked to major depression.\nWhat should I look for?\n• Warty brownish papules, coalescing into crusted plaques, in a\n seborrhoeic distribution (central trunk, forehead, scalp, flexures) )\n (see Fig. 32.4).\n• Papules may follow Blaschko lines in individuals who are mosaic for\n the mutation (see E p. 620 and Fig. 32.1).\n• Itch, discomfort, and, if severe, malodour.\n• Nails: fragility, red or white linear bands, V-shaped notches.\n• Pits or keratotic papules on palms and/or soles.\n• Flat, wart-like papules on the back of the hands and/or feet\n (acrokeratosis verruciformis).\n• Painful fissures, blisters, and erosions in some patients (simulating\n Hailey–Hailey disease (see Box 32.4 and Fig. 32.5).\n• Oral mucosal papules in some patients.\nWhat should I do?\n• Take a skin biopsy to look for acantholysis and dyskeratosis.\n (Differentiation from Hailey–Hailey disease may depend on the\n clinical presentation; see Box 32.4.)\n• Patients are at risk of widespread herpes simplex infection—advise\n on how to recognize (unusual pain, blisters, erosions, poor response\n to usual treatment).\n• Advise on avoiding disease triggers—heat, UVB.\n• Prescribe:\n • Emollients containing urea to reduce hyperkeratosis.\n • Topical antiseptics to reduce bacterial colonization.\n • In limited disease: topical retinoid with a topical corticosteroid.\n • In extensive disease: oral alitretinoin, acitretin, or isotretinoin\n reduce itch, hyperkeratosis, and malodour—contraception\n essential (see E p. 669).",

NEMO protein has a key role in the NF-κB signalling pathway involved in many functions, including cell survival. Loss of NEMO—\ncells are more sensitive to apoptosis.\nWhat should I look for?\nThe skin lesions following Blaschko lines are diagnostic. Typically, the\npresentation evolves through four stages, but these may overlap, or the\nfirst/second stage (s) may not manifest at all:\n• Stage 1. Linear erythematous or vesiculobullous eruption on the limbs\n or trunk, within 6 weeks of birth. May be present at birth. Blisters\n usually clear in 6 months. Recurring crops of blisters may be\n associated with a circulating eosinophilia. Smear from blisters will\n show eosinophils. Differential includes: erythema toxicum, infection\n (herpes simplex/zoster, or varicella), but the child is well. EB (rare).\n• Stage 2.

Certain features in the pigment\n network correlate with malignancy (see E p. 342 and p. 344).\n• Dermoscopy can also help in the diagnosis of non-pigmented skin\n tumours such as haemangiomas or BCCs (see E p. 350).\n• Dermoscopy is increasingly being used in medical dermatology. For\n example, the extra magnification has been advocated to visualize\n nail fold capillaries in patients with possible vasculitis or a connective\n tissue disorder (see E Box 19.19, p. 415), find the mites in suspected\n scabies (see E Box 8.2, p. 175), and assess the cause of alopecia (see\n E p. 488).\n• Dermoscopy can be used to screen hair shafts for abnormalities in\n conditions such as Netherton syndrome (see E Box 31.11, p. 603).\nFor more information, see M http://www.dermoscopy.co.uk and\nM http://www.dermoscopy-ids.org/.\nWood light (black light)\n• The light emits UVR in the long-wave UVA region.\n• Hypopigmentation is more obvious under Wood light, and\n examination may be particularly helpful in assessing a child with\n possible tuberous sclerosis for the presence of hypopigmented\n macules (see E Box 27.7, p. 557).\n• Depigmented skin, e.g. vitiligo, fluoresces a bright ivory-white, unlike\n hypopigmented skin which just looks pale.\n• Epidermal hyperpigmentation is accentuated by Wood light, but\n pigment that is mainly in the dermis is not accentuated (see\n E Box 30.1, p. 583).\n• Some cutaneous infections fluoresce:\n • Tinea capitis caused by Microsporum audouini or Microsporum\n canis: light bright green fluorescence.\n • Pityriasis versicolor: yellow fluorescence.\n • Erythrasma: coral pink fluorescence.\n • Pseudomonas: green fluorescence.\n• Urine containing porphyrins fluoresces pink (see E p. 332).",

A glass slide pressed down on the skin will blanch the\n erythema of an inflammatory lesion or the redness of a vascular\n tumour. Bleeding into the skin (petechiae or purpura) does not\n blanch.\n• Diascopy is recommended for assessing the reddish brown\n granulomatous lesions in sarcoid (see E p. 524) or cutaneous TB\n (see E p. 144). Gentle pressure enhances the yellow-brown ‘apple\n jelly’ colour of the dermal nodules by removing the background\n erythema.\n• Diascopy will also differentiate a naevus anaemicus (where\n vasoconstriction gives the skin a pale colour; see E p. 562) from a\n patch of hypopigmented or depigmented skin, e.g. vitiligo. A naevus\n anaemicus is no longer detectable, when a glass slide is pressed\n down gently onto the skin.

    "text": "Testing for allergy\n\nWhat is patch testing?\n• Dermatitis may be caused by delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity, and\n this type of allergy is detected by patch testing.\n• Hypersensitivity is confirmed by allergic contact dermatitis\n developing under a patch containing the allergen to which the\n individual is sensitized. The reaction develops gradually over\n several days.\n• The screening battery of patch tests contains standardized\n dilutions of allergens such as rubber allergens, neomycin and other\n medicaments, fragrance allergens, lanolin, and nickel.\n• Patch tests are generally put onto the skin of the back (day 0) and are\n usually read on day 2 and again on day 4.\n• Photopatch testing may be required for suspected photoallergic\n dermatitis. Two identical batteries of allergens are applied to the skin,\n but one side is irradiated with UVA after 24–48h.\n• It takes expertise to correctly select the allergens for testing, to read\n the tests, but especially to determine the significance of the results.\nWho should I refer for patch testing?\n• Patients with persistent eczematous eruptions, particularly longstanding facial dermatitis, hand dermatitis, or perianal pruritus.\n• Patients with chronic leg ulcers who may become sensitized to the\n constituents of dressings, bandages, or topical medicaments\n (see E p. 302).\nWhat is skin-prick testing?\n• Skin-prick testing detects immediate (type I) hypersensitivity.\n• Patients should stop taking antihistamines at least 48h before\n the test.\n• Drops of allergens in standardized dilutions are placed on marked\n areas on the forearm, and gentle intradermal punctures are made\n through each drop with separate sterile fine needles. Positive\n and negative controls are performed with histamine and saline,\n respectively.\n• Type I hypersensitivity is manifested by an urticarial wheal of 4mm or\n more that is usually apparent after 10–15min.\n• The risk of anaphylaxis is small, but tests should only be carried out\n by an experienced individual with facilities for resuscitation.\n• Specific IgE quantification is an alternative investigation (see Box 33.1).\nWho should I refer for skin-prick testing?\n• Prick testing is used in the investigation of some patients with acute\n urticarial reactions, but the relevance of positive results may be\n difficult to interpret (see E Box 11.3, p. 233).\n• Prick testing is not indicated in most patients with dermatitis,\n apart from those with hand dermatitis who may have a type\n I hypersensitivity to natural rubber latex, in addition to delayed (type",

If you are experienced, you can get a preliminary result in the outpatient room. Tzanck preparations (cytological\nsmears) are used infrequently in the UK.\nHow to make a Tzanck preparation\n• You will need a glass slide and a No. 10 or 15 scalpel blade.\n• Put on sterile gloves.\n• De-roof a fresh blister, and gently scrape the base (you only need\n tissue fluid and keratinocytes—try not to contaminate the smear with\n blood). Smear the contents of your blade onto a glass slide.\n• Air-dry; fix with methanol, and stain with Giemsa, toluidine blue, or\n Wright’s stain.\n• Examine under a light microscope (x40 magnification).\n• HSV or VZV infection: multinucleated giant keratinocytes confirm\n the diagnosis, but laboratory tests, such as PCR, are a more accurate\n diagnostic tool and have superseded Tzanck preparations.\n• Tzanck preparations may help to differentiate subepidermal from\n intra-epidermal blistering in autoimmune blistering diseases such\n as BP (subepidermal, no keratinocytes in Tzanck preparation) or\n pemphigus vulgaris (intra-epidermal, acantholytic rounded-up\n keratinocytes in Tzanck preparation).

The presence of keratinocytes in the smear suggests SSSS (the\n blister is in the granular layer, and some intact epidermis is retained\n in the floor of the blister). In TEN, the blister is subepidermal,\n so there are no keratinocytes on the floor of the blister, and a\n Tzanck preparation from the base of the blister will not have\n any keratinocytes. The preparation must be made from freshly\n denuded dermis, because, once the epidermis starts to regenerate,\n keratinocytes will be found in the smear. In practice, it is not usually\n difficult to differentiate the diseases, particularly if the patient has\n mucosal involvement (a feature of TEN, not SSSS) (see E p. 112,\n p. 116).",

    "text": "Skin biopsy in inflammatory conditions\nTaking a skin biopsy is not technically difficult, but it may be more challenging to provide the pathologist with a differential diagnosis, to know\nwhat sort of biopsy to take, and to choose the right site.\nWhat sort of biopsy\n• Pathologists prefer elliptical biopsies (see Box 33.3), because they\n provide more tissue than a punch biopsy (see Box 33.4), but a deep\n (uncrushed) 4mm punch biopsy is adequate in some situations.\n• Take a deep elliptical biopsy in panniculitis, when you need to\n examine fat lobules. The fat often shears off in punch biopsies.\n• Punch biopsies are particularly suitable for investigating alopecia,\n as the specimen is examined using both horizontal and vertical\n sectioning. Ensure you insert the punch deeply along the length of the\n hair follicle (see E Box 3.2, p. 45).\n• For the investigation of blistering diseases, an intact blister is\n preferred (see E Box 13.1, p. 267).\nWhere to take the biopsy\n• Generally, choose a well-developed 1° lesion, avoiding 2° changes\n such as excoriations. If the rash has a variety of morphologies, you\n may wish to take several biopsies.\n• Try to avoid taking biopsies from the leg (poor healing) or the cape\n area, i.e. shoulders, upper back, and central chest (risk of keloid).\n• When taking a facial biopsy, use the direction of natural wrinkles\n to disguise the scar. Ask the patient to screw up his/her face to\n determine the direction of the incisional biopsy or the position of the\n punch biopsy.\n• In blistering diseases, take the biopsy from a small early intact blister.\n If you select a large blister, the roof of the specimen may be lost\n during processing. In old blisters, re-epithelialization at the base of\n subepidermal blisters can mimic intra-epidermal blisters.\n• If you suspect a condition, such as CTCL, it is worth taking multiple\n incisional biopsies. Be prepared to repeat the biopsies on several\n occasions over a number of years, before your clinical suspicions are\n confirmed.\nWorking with the pathologist\n• You are not setting a mind-reading exercise for your pathology\n colleague! You had the advantage of seeing the patient, so describe\n the rash on the request form, and tell the pathologist what diagnoses\n you are considering, what sort of lesion you have biopsied (fresh,\n well-developed, blister, papule, etc.), and the site of the biopsy.\n• Become familiar with the terms commonly used to describe\n pathological changes in the skin (see E p. 650).\n• Histopathology, like all of medicine, is an art, as well as a science.\n If the diagnosis provided by the pathologist does not fit the clinical\n findings, you both need to think again.

    "text": "Box 33.3 Elliptical biopsy: how to do it\n• The biopsy should either remove an entire lesion or extend from\n normal skin into the centre of the lesion. The longitudinal axis of\n the incision should run parallel to the wrinkle lines (face) or Langers\n lines (trunk, limbs; see E p. 8) and measure 1cm in length.\n• Mark out an elongated diamond shape with a sterile skin marker,\n prior to infiltration of local anaesthetic.\n• Clean the skin, and infiltrate local anaesthetic (see Box 33.4).\n• Incise vertically down into subcutaneous tissue, using a No. 15\n scalpel blade. Lift up the specimen at a corner, and peel back,\n cutting the base with the scalpel. Do not crush the specimen.\n• Close with interrupted or intradermal sutures.\n\nBox 33.4 Punch biopsy: how to do it\n• Mark the biopsy site.\n• In children, 2.5% lidocaine plus 2.5% prilocaine cream (EMLA®),\n applied under occlusion for 40–60min, reduces the pain of\n infiltration:\n • Infants <3 months: maximum dose = 1g.\n • Infants >3 months: maximum dose = 2g.\n• Consider restraining infants by wrapping firmly in a sheet.\n• Lidocaine 1% with adrenaline 1 in 200000 is suitable for most sites\n (avoid in digits). Warm the local anaesthetic to body temperature,\n prior to infiltration, and infiltrate slowly to minimize discomfort.\n• Local anaesthetic in infants:\n • Lidocaine 1% without adrenaline: up to 3mg/kg (maximum for a\n 5kg infant = 1.5mL).\n • Lidocaine 1% with adrenaline 1 in 200000: up to 5mg/kg\n (maximum for a 5kg infant = 2.5mL).\n• Allow 20–30min for the anaesthetic and adrenaline to act, before\n taking the biopsy. Go away, and do something else.\n• Do not attempt to check if the skin is numb by jabbing with a\n needle. Instead, ask an adult patient to tell you if the procedure is\n uncomfortable.\n• Stabilize the skin. Insert the punch slowly down into fat, watching\n the patient’s face. (The expression will tell you if it is painful.)\n• Minimal pressure is needed, particularly in children or elderly\n people with thin skin. Disposable punches are very sharp.\n• Depress the skin firmly on each side of the wound, so the specimen\n pops up, and lift it out on the tip of your scissors—you may need\n to cut the base with a sharp pair of scissors. Do not damage the\n specimen by crushing it with forceps or spearing it with a needle!\n• If needed, only handle the specimen with a skin hook.\n• Usually, sutures are not required if you have used adrenaline.\n Haemostasis can be obtained using topical 20% aluminium chloride\n or a piece of calcium alginate dressing in the wound and pressure.",

Use a milder corticosteroid in these areas.\nAvoid potent or very potent corticosteroids on the face, except in special circumstances, e.g. acute contact dermatitis, chronic cutaneous LE.\n Commonly used topical corticosteroids include:\n• Mild:\n • Hydrocortisone 0.5%, 1%, or 2.5%.\n • Hydrocortisone with antibiotic.\n • Hydrocortisone with antifungal (used for inflamed flexural rashes\n when candidiasis may complicate treatment with corticosteroid).\n• Moderate:\n • Betamethasone valerate cream 0.025%, clobetasone\n butyrate 0.05%.\n • Moderate with antibacterials and antifungals (clobetasone\n butyrate 0.05%, oxytetracycline 3% (as calcium salt), nystatin\n 100000 units).\n• Potent:\n • Betamethasone valerate 0.1%, mometasone furoate 0.1%,\n hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%.\n • Potent with antimicrobials.\n • Potent with salicylic acid, e.g. betamethasone 0.05% with salicylic\n acid 3%.\n• Very potent:\n • Clobetasol propionate 0.05%, diflucortolone valerate 0.3%.\nHow to apply\n• No more frequently than twice daily; once daily is often sufficient (see\n Box 34.2).\n• Spread thinly on the affected skin. One FTU (7500mg) is sufficient to\n cover an area that is twice that of the flat adult palm (see Box 34.3).\n• Apply about 20–30min after (or before) any emollient.\n• Undertreatment because of steroid phobia is a common cause of\n treatment failure.

    "text": "Occlusion\nOcclusion cools and soothes itchy skin, also protects the skin by preventing the damage wrought by fingernails, particularly at night. Consider\nocclusion in chronically itchy conditions, when endless rubbing has thickened the skin (lichenification; see E Fig. 31.9, p. 611) or resulted in nodules (prurigo; see E p. 222). Occlusion softens scaly skin and enhances\nthe penetration of topical corticosteroids applied under the dressing or\nbandage. Do not occlude infected skin.\nOcclusive dressings\n• For a localized area of chronic irritation, prescribe a self-adhesive\n hydrocolloid dressing in combination with a potent or very potent\n topical corticosteroid ointment.\n• Apply the ointment thinly to the active area.\n• Cut a piece of the sticky hydrocolloid to cover the affected area and\n 1cm of surrounding skin. Trim the corners, so it is an oval shape.\n• Apply the dressing, and hold it in place firmly for several minutes,\n until it warms up, becomes tacky, and sticks firmly to the skin.\n• Advise the patient to leave the dressing in place for about 6 days (the\n patient can bathe or shower as normal), and then remove it to give\n the skin a 24-h ‘breathing’ period. Then the patient should apply\n more ointment and another dressing.\n• Continue treatment, until the itch and inflammation settles. This may\n take a few weeks or several months.\nMedicated stockings\n• Zipzoc® are tubular rayon stockings impregnated with ointment\n containing 20% zinc oxide. Zipzoc® were developed for patients with\n chronic leg ulcers, but the stockings have proved extremely useful in\n patients, including children, with chronic eczema.\n• The stockings are easy to use. Simply cut to length, and pull on.\n• Corticosteroid ointment may be applied beneath the stocking.\n• An overlying cotton tubular bandage will prevent staining of clothing\n or bedding.\n• It may be possible to remove and reuse a Zipzoc® on several\n consecutive nights.\nMedicated paste bandages\n• The bandage may be impregnated with coal tar, icthammol, calamine,\n or zinc paste. Paste bandages are particularly useful for managing\n gravitational eczema associated with chronic venous leg ulcers, when\n they can be used under compression bandages (see Fig. 34.1).\n• An emollient or topical corticosteroid ointment may be applied to\n areas of eczema beneath the bandage.\n• Paste bandages, unlike Zipzoc®, are tricky to apply properly\n (see Box 34.4).",

Wrap the bandage around the limb once in one direction,\n until the ends meet, and then fold the bandage back upon itself, and\n apply in the opposite direction, slightly overlapping the previous\n turn of the bandage. Continue up the limb, reversing the direction\n of each turn of the bandage to avoid a circumferential band.\n • A cohesive elastic bandage, such as Coban®, applied over the paste\n bandage will hold everything in place.\n • Leave for up to 1 week.\n • The patient should use a clean polythene bin liner to protect the\n bandage in the shower or bath.\n\nFig. 34.1 Bandaging technique.\n\nFurther reading\nThe British Dermatological Nursing Group.

    "text": "Soaks, wet dressings, and ‘wet wraps’\nAstringent lotions are used to clean, dry, and soothe weeping eczema or\nblistering eruptions. Solutions are antiseptic and are also used to reduce\nbacterial contamination in chronic ulcers. The limb is soaked for 10–\n20min once or twice a day. You do not need anything more complicated\nthan a plastic bucket and a bin liner, but you will have to explain to the\npatient and/or carer exactly what to do.\n Wet dressings are a cooling and antiseptic alternative to soaks that\nmay be used on an area that is difficult to soak in a bucket. Dip clean\ngauze in the solution, and apply as a compress to the affected skin several times a day. ‘Wet wraps’ may be used for short periods to relieve\nitching in conditions such as acute atopic eczema, particularly in infants.\nThe wraps reduce itch by cooling the skin but also enhance the effect of\ntopical treatments, including moisturizers, and protect itchy skin from\nfingernails. Do not use wet wraps if there are any signs of cutaneous\ninfection.\nPreparations for weeping eczematous skin or blistering\n• Potassium permanganate (available in the UK as Permitabs®). Line a\n bucket with a clean bin liner, and half-fill with tap water. Put on gloves;\n add 1 Permitab® to the water, and agitate to ensure the potassium\n permanganate dissolves completely. Undissolved crystals at the\n bottom of the container could burn the skin. Dilute with more water,\n continuing to stir, until you have a uniform pale pink solution, the\n colour of rosé wine (1 Permitab® dissolved in 4L of water = 0.01%\n solution). The solution will stain fabric, skin, and nails brown. Coat\n nails with petroleum jelly, prior to soaking, to avoid staining. Remove\n brown stains on the skin with lemon juice. Potassium permanganate\n solution may be added to a bath—but the bath will be stained\n permanently!\n• Silver nitrate 0.5% solution.\n• Aluminium acetate solution 0.13–0.5% (Burow solution). This is\n available in the USA as tablets or powder for dissolving in water.\nPreparations for chronic leg ulcers\n(Also see E p. 306.)\n• Prontosan® wound irrigation solution is an antibacterial wash which\n contains betaine (surfactant) and polyhexanide (antimicrobial).\n• Potassium permanganate solution—discussed earlier in this section.\n• Acetic acid—2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar to 1 pint of tap water—is\n useful for chronic leg ulcers colonized with Pseudomonas (indicated by\n malodorous bright green dressings).\n• Wet gauze dressings soaked in the antiseptic solution may be applied\n to the ulcer and kept wet for 20min.\nFurther reading\nBritish Association of Dermatologists.

    "text": "Systemic drugs in dermatology\nWe provide no more than pointers to using these drugs—please read\ndetailed prescribing guidelines and local protocols. Involve the patient in\nany decision about his/her treatment (see E p. 31, Box 2.11). Discuss\nhow long the drug will take to act and what the outcome might be, but\noffer written, as well as verbal, information. Explain the importance of\nmonitoring, and encourage patients to keep their own record, either\nhand-held or electronic. The patient should bring this to clinic visits.\nGenerally, you will share monitoring with the GP, according to a local\nprotocol—read this, so you know what is expected of you. In many\ndepartments, specialist nurses monitor patients on systemic treatment,\nbut the prescriber has overall responsibility.\nAntihistamines\n• Non-sedating: chronic urticaria, e.g. fexofenadine, cetirizine,\n loratadine, rupatadine.\n• Sedating: for itching, e.g. hydroxyzine, chlorphenamine, but treat any\n underlying skin problem or systemic disease causing the itch. Caution\n in elderly.\nAzathioprine\nAzathioprine is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drug that\nis converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Some 6-MP is catabolized to\ninactive metabolites by enzymes such as thiopurine methyltransferase\n(TPMT). Other pathways produce 6-MP metabolites that interfere with\ncell division and function of T- and B-cells. Dose: 2–2.5mg/kg/day.\nWhat should I do?\n• Measure TPMT activity or check the genotype, before starting\n treatment. A mutation in the TPMT gene lowers enzyme activity and\n increases the risk of myelosuppression. Approximately one in ten of\n the population is heterozygous (intermediate activity), and one in 100\n homozygous (low activity) for the mutation. Prescribe a low dose, if\n the TPMT activity is reduced.\n• Warn about nausea and diarrhoea. Limit alcohol intake.\n• Warn about the increased risk of malignancy, including skin cancer,\n with long-term treatment. Advise the patient to use sun protection\n (see E pp. 338–9).\n• Monitor for hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression, initially with\n weekly FBC and LFT. Increased risk of pancytopenia with allopurinol.\n• Avoid live vaccines, e.g. oral polio, BCG, rubella. Influenza and\n pneumococcal vaccines are safe and are recommended.\nCiclosporin\nCiclosporin is an immunosuppressant drug that blocks calcineurin, thus\npreventing the activation of T-cells. It is metabolized by the cytochrome\nP450 pathway and is susceptible to interaction with other drugs inhibiting\nor inducing these enzymes. Duration of treatment should be <2 years,\nwhenever possible. Dose: 2.5–5mg/kg/day.",

    "text": "What should I do?\n• Check FBC, and renal and liver function before starting, and monitor\n during treatment (weekly initially and then every 1–3 months).\n• Warn patients about adverse effects of nausea, diarrhoea, and\n anaemia.\n• Advise patients to use sun protection (increased risk of skin cancers if\n taken in conjunction with other immunosuppressants).\n• Avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 6 weeks after stopping.\nRetinoids\nThe retinoids are analogues of vitamin A that regulate gene transcription via intracellular nuclear receptors. They have diverse effects on\ncell differentiation and proliferation, immune function, and embryonic\ndevelopment. Acitretin (a metabolite of etretinate) is used in disorders\nof keratinization, e.g. severe psoriasis. Oral isotretinoin (0.25–1 mg/kg/\nday) is used in severe acne. Acitretin is also used to reduce the risk of skin\ncancers developing in organ transplant recipients. Alitretinoin is used to\ntreat severe chronic hand eczema.\nWhat should I do?\n• Oral retinoids are teratogenic and must be avoided in pregnancy.\n You will be expected to follow a protocol for prescribing, dispensing,\n and monitoring these drugs. Women of childbearing age must sign\n a consent form, agree to use secure contraception (two types\n are recommended), and agree to have monthly pregnancy tests.\n Contraception should be continued for at least 1 month after\n stopping isotretinoin, and 2 years after stopping acitretin. In practice,\n acitretin is rarely used in women of childbearing age.\n• Common adverse effects include dryness of mucous membranes\n and skin, muscle aches and pains, photosensitivity, raised serum\n triglycerides or cholesterol, and raised liver enzymes. Headache and\n flushing are additional side effects observed with alitretinoin.\n• Check plasma lipids (fasting) and liver function prior to starting\n treatment, and then monitor 1-to 3-monthly, depending on the\n retinoid prescribed.\nThalidomide\nThalidomide was used in the 1950s as a sedative and antiemetic, but\nphocomelia was a tragic adverse effect, and, by 1961, the drug had been\nwithdrawn worldwide. Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions that may be mediated by inhibition of TNF-α.\nWhat should I do?\n• The risk of birth defects is 100% if the drug is taken in the first 21–\n 36 days of gestation. Thalidomide must be prescribed and dispensed\n in accordance with the Thalidomide Celgene® Pregnancy Prevention\n Programme. Prescribers must read the Programme information\n and complete the appropriate forms. Pharmacists must register\n with Celgene®.

    "text": "Biologics in dermatology\nSee Box 34.5.\n\n Box 34.5 Biologics in dermatology\n Biologic drugs include monoclonal antibodies and a variety of protein\n drugs, which alter the activity of cytokines, enzymes, and growth factors. They can be a useful alternative when standard treatments have\n failed, but are expensive, and their immunosuppressive properties can\n increase the risk of infections, in particular Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n There is also a potential increase in the risk of malignancies.\n Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors\n Infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab are anti-TNF\n monoclonal antibodies. Etanercept is a TNF receptor fusion protein.\n Indications: Inflammatory skin conditions, e.g. psoriasis, hidradenitis\n suppurativa.\n Adverse cutaneous effects include plaque, guttate, erythrodermic,\n and pustular psoriasis, and sarcoid-like granulomatosis (also occurs in\n lungs).\n Interleukin antagonists\n Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody, which binds to the p40 subunit\n of IL-12 and IL-23. Indications: plaque psoriasis. Can trigger pustular\n psoriasis.\n Secukinumab is an anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody. Also used for\n psoriasis.\n Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) and canakinumab (IL-1β monoclonal antibody) are used for auto-inflammatory syndromes.\n Newer agents include dupilimumab (IL-4 and IL-13 blocker) that may\n have benefits for atopic eczema.\n Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors\n Apremilast is a PDE 4 inhibitor under investigation for treatment of\n psoriasis.\n B-cell therapies\n Rituximab is a chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibody against\n CD20, a surface molecule expressed on B-lymphocytes. Rituximab\n prevents the development of antibody-producing cells.\n Indications include connective tissue diseases, e.g. SLE, or bullous\n disease.\n Immunoglobulin inhibitors\n Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody to IgE Fc region developed for\n treatment of asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria.",
