It has been specifically written\nfor nurse practitioners, specialist nurses, physicians or any other clinicians\nwho undertake structured histories using advanced decision-making skills.\nIt will aid in diagnosis - recognising differential diagnosis, formulating\nprescriptions and assisting in identifying referral pathways if necessary.\n\nThe booklet is divided into three parts.\n\n Part 1\n\nPart 1 (sections 01-03) starts with a review of the structure and functions\nof the skin, then takes the practitioner through history taking and\ndescribing the characteristics of the presenting skin condition.\n\n Part 2\n\nIn part 2 (sections 04-06), we provide information on the more common\nskin conditions, including clinical images, diagnosis and suggested\ntreatment*. There is also advice on practical aspects of coping with\nthe presenting condition for the patient, parent or carer. Finally, there\nis guidance on when specialist referral is indicated.\n\n Part 3\n\nIn part 3 (sections 07-09) you will find practical advice on emollient\nand steroid therapy, a glossary of terms, useful websites and a list\nof reference books for further reading.\n\nThe aim of this booklet is to assist the clinician in managing most of the\ncommon dermatological conditions they are likely to encounter in their\nclinical practice.\n\n* To prescribe the correct dose of suggested treatments, please refer to British National\n Formulary (www.BNF.org) or British National Formulary for Children (www.BNFC.org)",

The skin is also\nresponsible for sensory perception, temperature regulation, production\nof vitamin D and excretion of waste products. In addition to preventing\nharmful substances from entering the body, it also controls the loss of\nvital substances from the body. It is therefore important that the skin\nremains intact to allow the body to perform these essential functions.\n\nThe skin contains a number of accessory organs which assist in its protective\nrole. As we can see in Fig. 1, it consists of two main layers: the epidermis, or\nouter layer and the dermis which lies beneath the epidermis",

Cells move from the base of the epidermis up to the surface,\nchanging shape and structure as they go. The epidermis is made up of\nstratified squamous epithelium or hardened cells which play a role in the\nskin’s protective function. This is referred to as the stratum corneum.\n\nEpidermal cells line the hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands.\n\nA number of projections which reach down from the epidermis to the\ndermis can be found at the point at which they join. These are called rete\npegs, which help to maintain skin integrity when the skin is under stress.\n\nMelanocytes are cells found in the deepest layer of the epidermis. They\nproduce melanin, which helps protect the body from the sun’s harmful rays.",

The two layers identified within the dermis\nare the papillary layer and the reticular layer. Key substances found in\nthe dermis include elastin, fibrillin and collagen (which helps give support\nand protection), all of which will decrease with age.\n\nThe dermis also contains nerve endings, sweat glands, sebaceous\nglands, hair follicles and blood vessels. The papillary dermis contains\nsmaller blood vessels which supply oxygen, elastic fibres and nutrients\nto the lower epidermis.\n\nThe nerve endings sense pain, touch, temperature and pressure and are\na vital part of the body’s protective mechanisms. There are more nerve\nendings in certain parts of the body, such as the fingertips and toes.",

    "text": "Sweat glands produce sweat, which contains some body waste products,\nwater and salt. Evaporating sweat causes cooling of the body. Sweat\nfrom the axilla and groin areas (apocrine glands) is more oily in nature and\nproduces a characteristic odour when digested by the skin bacteria.\n\nSebaceous glands secrete sebum into hair follicles. Sebum is an oily\nsubstance that keeps the skin moist and acts as a barrier against foreign\nsubstances.\n\nHair follicles produce the various hair types that can be found around\nthe body, so can affect a person’s appearance. Hair is also involved in\nprotecting the body from injury and can improve sensation.\n\nThe blood vessels within the dermis are involved in temperature regulation.\n\nThe thicker reticular dermis contains dense connective tissue, larger\nblood vessels, elastic fibres and bundles of collagen arranged in layers.\n\nAlso within the reticular layer are the following key cell types:\n\n • fibroblasts − a key cell involved in repairing tissue damage\n • mast cells − which are involved in fighting infection\n • lymphatic vessels – the lymphatic system is a key part of the\n body’s defence against infection\n • epidermal appendages or rete pegs – as explained above, the\n epidermis and dermis are linked in this way to prevent skin damage\n • ground substance − a gel-like substance that helps to support the\n cells within the dermis and provides structure to the area.",

The precursor lesion of all acne lesions is the microcomedone\nwhich, under the influence of androgens, develops into non-inflammatory\nlesions (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules).\nLesions of acne vary considerably with time, but in acne vulgaris\ncomedones are always present and are a diagnostic sign. Most patients\nnotice a fluctuation in the number and severity of spots. In young women,\nthis is often related to the menstrual cycle.",

The weals can vary from a few millimetres to several\ncentimetres in diameter and can become very extensive, developing in\nmany sites at once.

    "text": "Presentation\nThe rash is made up of excoriated papules scattered over the trunk and\nlimbs but sparing the face (except in infants). The patient will experience\nintense itch, especially at night. Identification of one or more burrow\nwill confirm the diagnosis. Burrows are most often found on the hands\nand feet in the sides of the fingers and toes and web spaces. In infants,\nburrows are often present on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n\n Treatment\n5% permethrin cream or 0.5% malathion lotion can be used. It is\nimportant to take the time to explain to the patient exactly how to use\nthe treatment, and explanatory treatment sheets are also useful. All\nfamily members and close physical contacts with the affected individual\nshould be treated simultaneously. Advise the patient not have a bath\nor shower prior to applying treatment. Topical applications should be\napplied from the neck to the toes, paying particular attention to behind\nboth ears, axillae, under breasts, navel, groin and genital areas, and\nbetween fingers and toes. The patient should be reminded not to wash\ntheir hands after applying treatment. If hands need to be washed during\nthe night, further application is required. The treatment is applied at night\nbefore the patient goes to bed and is left on for the allotted time. After the\nallotted time, the treatment should be washed off in the bath or shower.\nUnderwear, nightwear and bed sheets should be changed. Bedding and\nnightwear should be washed and ironed.\n\n Advice to patient\nItch does not resolve immediately following treatment but will gradually\nimprove over 2−3 weeks in some individuals, although it may take up\nto 8 weeks to finally resolve. Residual itch can be treated with a mild or\nmoderate topical steroid or crotamiton cream twice a day together with\nregular emollient therapy.",

For\nthe face, 1% hydrocortisone or equivalent (weak) should be prescribed.\nStart with this elsewhere and only prescribe something stronger if this\ndoes not work. In general practice, it is rarely necessary to use anything\nstronger than a moderately potent steroid for extensive eczema. For\nlocalised persistent eczema, a potent steroid can be useful. Very potent\nsteroids should rarely be used.\n\n15g of ointment or cream is enough to cover the adult body once. To\ncover the whole body for a week if applied twice daily will require 200g.\nIf a patient has widespread eczema, adequate amounts of topical steroid\nshould be prescribed to avoid relapse. A useful guide to using the correct\namount of topical steroid is the finger-tip unit guide, which is the amount\nof cream/ointment squeezed onto the index finger from tip to the first\njoint. This amount will cover the area of two palms.\n\nThe potency of a steroid can be enhanced by the base used: for\nexample, an ointment base makes a steroid more potent than a cream or\nlotion. Additionally, the ability of a topical steroid to be absorbed varies\naccording to the site and the condition of the skin. The diagram opposite\ndemonstrates these differences.",
