    "text": "PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\n\nThe Rational Use of Medicines results into a more effective treatment at an affordable cost.\nEssential Medicines List (EML) and the Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG) are an\nimportant component of promoting rational use of medicines. Gujarat Medical Service\nCorporation Limited under the auspices of Department of Health & Family Welfare,\nGovernment of Gujarat finalizes EML and has undertaken the task to develop STG for the\nState. The objective is to improve the availability of quality drugs at each health facility and\nto achieve maximum public health improvement using available resources. B. J. Medical\nCollege & Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad has been instrumental in the preparation of the STG.\nAn attempt has been made in this manual to provide guidelines for the treatment of common\ndiseases, keeping in mind the rational use of medicines. It is a blend of evidence from\nstandard text and reference books with consensus of specialists. The guidelines are\ncomprehensive, concise and seek to summarize treatment plan for patients with priority\ndiseases. It is assumed that the patient has been fully evaluated and all co-morbidities\nidentified. Under each clinical condition, the treatment plan has been suggested that can be\napplied to average patient with common presentation. However, there may be great variations\nin patient presentation, their family history, treatment preferences and tolerance for different\nside effect. Therefore, these guidelines can be viewed as an expert consultation and weighed\nwith respect to other information. Moreover, the recommendations do not replace clinical\njudgment nor encroach on clinical flexibility, which must be tailored to the particular needs\nof each clinical situation.\nA large number of experienced clinicians have contributed in the preparation of these\nguidelines. The manual begins with a brief introduction to the concept of Rational Use of\nMedicines along with its important components. This is followed by chapters on common\ndiseases and emergency conditions which may be general to all specialties. Remaining\nchapters describe frequent clinical conditions in each specialty, for example ENT, Psychiatry,\nObstetrics and Gynecology etc. The format of the guidelines includes important salient\nfeatures, diagnostic tests followed by non-pharmacological, pharmacological treatment plan\nand patient education, if applicable. Medicines are mentioned in generic names and choice is\nbased on the balanced criteria of efficacy, safety, suitability and cost.\nThis manual will be useful as ready reference for the health care providers and supply\nmanagement staff. We hope this manual will help in pursuance of the objectives of Rational\nUse of Medicines and make the treatment more specific and effective. We thank all the\nexperts for sharing their valuable time and expertise in developing the book.\n\n Dr. Mira Desai\n Dr. Samidh Shah\n Dr. Geetha Iyer",

    "text": "Chapter 1\n INTRODUCTION TO RATIONAL USE OF MEDICINES\n\nRational Use of Medicines requires that patients receive medications appropriate to their\nclinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of\ntime, and at affordable cost to them and the community (WHO, 1985). In other words,\nrational use means ‘prescribing right medicines, in adequate dose for the sufficient duration\nand appropriate to the clinical needs of the patient at lowest cost’. Medicine use is a complex\ncyclical process and in the clinical context, rational drug use implies correct drug, appropriate\nindication and selection with respect to efficacy, safety, suitability for the patient and cost.\nThe concept of Rational Use of Medicines is age old; however, it has attained more\nsignificance and momentum in terms of medical and socioeconomic aspects recently. Three\ntools have been identified to implement Rational Use of Medicines effectively. These include\nEssential Medicines List, Standard Treatment Guidelines and Drug Formulary. To be\nmeaningful, all three tools should work in concert and subject for periodic review and update.\n\nI. The concept of Essential Medicines\n Essential Medicines (EM) are those that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of\n the population and therefore should be available at all times in appropriate amounts and in\n appropriate dosage forms. Following the concept of EM, WHO published the first\n Essential Medicine List (EML) in 1977, which has been updated successively every 5\n year in view of changing world scenario about the medical needs and availability of new\n and better drugs. The selection of these medicines is based on public health relevance,\n evidence of efficacy and safety and comparative cost-effectiveness. These priority\n medicines should be available at each functioning health care facility with assured quality\n and adequate information at a price the individual and the community can afford.\n The selection of essential medicines depends upon level of health care facility, adequate\n data on the efficacy, safety, suitability and comparative cost effectiveness of available\n treatments. In addition, stability of the product, need for special diagnostic or treatment\n facilities and pharmacokinetic properties are also considered. Most essential medicines\n are formulated as single compound. However, fixed dose combinations are selected only\n when it has proven pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic advantages over single\n compound administered separately. While comparing the cost of medicines among the\n alternative treatments, the cost of total treatment and not the unit cost is considered. Other\n factors taken into account include pattern of diseases, treatment facilities, training and\n experience of the available personnel, financial resources etc.\n\n Advantages of Essential Medicines\nThe implementation of the concept of EM has several logistic and prescribing advantages.\nFor example better management of medicines i.e. easier procurement, storage,\n\n 1",

    "text": "distribution, more manageable stock, better quality assurance, easier dispensing, less\n fragmentation of budget with improve drug availability. Moreover, prescribing improves\n due to focused training and drug information, better recognition of adverse drug reactions,\n drug interactions and focused education efforts. The list of EM closely relates to\n treatment guidelines for clinical diseases and is also used for the procurement and supply\n of medicines in public sector, schemes for reimburses medicines costs and local medicine\n production.\n Its implementation is intended to be flexible and adaptable to different situations; which\n medicines are regarded as essential remains a national responsibility.\n\nII. Standard Treatment Guidelines\n Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs), treatment protocols, and prescribing policies are\n defined as systematically developed statements designed to assist prescribers in making\n decisions about the appropriate treatment and health care for specific clinical problem.\n These guidelines usually reflect the consensus on the optimal treatment options within a\n health facility or system. In fact, they represent one of the approaches to promote\n therapeutically effective and economically efficient use of medicines.\n STGs list the preferred pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for common\n health problems experienced by people in a specific health system. The pharmacological\n treatment should include the name, dosage form, strength, average dose (pediatric and\n adult), number of doses per day, and duration of treatment. Other information on\n diagnosis and advice to the patient may also be included. The most common diseases and\n serious medical conditions that have high morbidity and mortality rate are selected.\n Treatment guidelines must have the most up-to-date and evidence based information to\n determine appropriate treatment options by expert authors and reviewers. Effective\n implementation, however, is perhaps the greatest challenge in introducing STGs. When\n implemented effectively, it offers several advantages to patients, health care providers,\n supply management personnel and policy makers as follows:\n Patients,\n Most cost-effective optimal therapy is provided.\n Better compliance through consistency among prescribers.\n Improvement in availability of drugs.\n Overall better quality of care.\n Health care providers,\n Provides standardized guidance to practitioners\n Quality of care standard- based on expert consensus and basis for monitoring\n Utilizes only formulary or essential medicines, so the health care system needs to\n provide only the medicines in the STGs.\n Supply managers,\n Identification of medicines to be available for the most commonly treated problems.\n\n 2",

Establishing, developing and implementation of STGs\n is a difficult, lengthy and time consuming process. Moreover, it needs to be updated\n regularly to reflect changes in treatment strategies. If a regular schedule for updating the\n STGs is not followed, they lose credibility and become obsolete. The extent of\n information to be provided in each medical condition is often a difficult decision.\n However, the STG manual should be concise and small enough to carry it easily.\n\n Key features of a successful STG manual\n Simplicity- The number of health problem is limited to commonly observed conditions.\n Each clinical condition list a few salient features with clear and concise information on\n pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatment.\n Credibility- Guidelines developed by the most respected experienced clinicians in the\n country and revision is based on actual experience.\n Treatment standards for all levels of health care facility- Health care providers use the\n same standard treatment; however, the referral criterion differs. While the first choice\n treatment for a patient depends upon the patient’s diagnosis and condition and not on the\n prescriber.\n Medicine supply based on standards- The supply of medicines must match with the\n standard treatment and list of essential medicines.\n Regular updating- Any change in the therapeutic options, bacterial resistance pattern\n should be incorporated in the revised version to reflect current recommendations.\n User friendly- The STGs should be published as small, durable pocket manual which\n make it convenient to carry and use.\n\nIII.Drug Formulary\n A formulary is a compendium of practical drug information for clinical practice adapted\n for use at a particular health care facility. It is a ready reference to key information on the\n selection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines. Although the concept\n of formulary is old, a drug formulary is considered an essential element in achieving\n rational prescribing in addition to controlling the costs. The task of development of a\n formulary in a hospital is usually undertaken by Drugs and Therapeutics Committee with\n a multidisciplinary membership of doctors, pharmacists, nurses and administrative staff.\n\n 3",

The committee may accept the\n request and include it in formulary or reject and suggest an alternative with information to\n the prescriber. The committee then monitors the impact, cost and benefits of various\n medicines in the health care facility. Depending on the outcome, the use of medicine is\n extended or curtailed. Formularies have significant advantages for patients care.\n However, the introduction of formularies may cause friction since it may be viewed as a\n major threat to their clinical freedom. Effective multidisciplinary working methods and\n consultation is needed to overcome this attitude. Potential advantages and disadvantages\n of drug formularies are as follows:\n Advantages\n Reduces range of products to be purchased / stored / distributed\n Encourages generic prescribing\n Lowers drug costs\n Improved knowledge of a limited number of medicines\n Improves drug safety\n Improves patient care\n Provides opportunity for multidisciplinary work\n Disadvantages\n Restricts prescribing choice\n Reduces treatment options\n Inhibits introduction of new products\n Restricts research efforts\n\nIV.Rational Approach To Therapeutics\n Medicines should only be prescribed when necessary, and the benefit of administering the\n medicine should be considered in relation to the risks involved. Bad prescribing habits\n lead to ineffective and unsafe treatment, exacerbation or prolongation of illness, distress\n and harm to the patient, and higher cost. The Guide to Good Prescribing; WHO; 1994,\n provides medical undergraduates with important tools for training in the process of\n rational prescribing.\n The following steps will help to remind prescribers of the rational approach to\n therapeutics.\n 1. Define the patient’s problem\n Whenever possible, making the right diagnosis is based on integrating many pieces of\n information: the complaint as described by the patient; a detailed history; physical\n examination; laboratory tests; X-rays and other investigations. This will help in rational\n prescribing, always bearing in mind that disease are evolutionary process.\n\n 4",

    "text": "2. Specify the therapeutic objective\nDoctors must clearly state their therapeutic objectives based on the pathophysiology\nunderlying the clinical situation. Very often physicians must select more than one\ntherapeutic goal for each patient.\n3. Selecting therapeutic strategies\nThe selected strategy should be discussed with the patient. The selected treatment can be\nnon-pharmacological and/or pharmacological; it also needs to take into account the total\ncost of all therapeutic options.\na. Non-pharmacological treatment\nThe patient does not always need a medicine for treatment of the condition. Very often,\nhealth problems can be resolved by a change in life style, dietary habits, use of\nphysiotherapy or exercise, provision of adequate psychological support and other nonpharmacological treatments; they have the same importance as a prescription drug and\ninstructions must be written, explained and monitored in the same way.\nb. Pharmacological treatment\nSelecting the correct group of drugs\nKnowledge about the pathophysiology involved in the clinical situation of each patient\nand the pharmacodynamics of the chosen group of drugs, are two of the fundamental\nprinciples for rational therapeutics.\nSelecting the drug from the chosen group\nThe selection process must consider benefit/risk/cost information. This step is based on\nevidence about maximal clinical benefits of the drug for a given indication (efficacy) with\nminimum production of adverse effects (safety).\nIt must be remembered that each drug has adverse effects and it is estimated that up to\n10% of hospital admissions in industrialized countries are due to adverse effects. Not all\ndrug-induced injury can be prevented but much of it is caused by inappropriate selection\nof drugs.\nIn cost comparisons between drugs, the cost of total treatment and not only the unit cost\nof the drug must be considered.\nVerifying the suitability of the chosen pharmaceutical treatment of each patient\nThe prescriber must check suitability of the chosen active substance, its dosage form,\ndosage schedule and duration of treatment are suitable for each patient. Drug treatment\nshould be individualized to the needs of each patient.\nPrescription writing\nThe prescription is the link between the prescriber, the pharmacist (or dispenser) and the\npatient so it is important for successful management of presenting medical condition. The\nitem is covered in more detail in the following section.\nGiving information, instructions and warnings\nThis step is important to ensure patient adherence and is covered in detail in the following\nsection.\n\n 5",

This step gives rise to\n important information about the effects and adverse effects of medicines, contributing to\n the evidence of knowledge, necessary to promote the rational use of drugs.\n\nV. Adverse Drug Effects and Drug Interactions\n Adverse drug reactions\n An adverse drug reaction (ADR) may be defined as ‘A response to a drug which is\n noxious, unintended and occurs at doses normally used for prophylaxis, diagnosis or\n therapy of disease, or for the modification of physiological function’. ADRs are therefore\n unwanted or unintended effects of a medicine, including idiosyncratic effects, which\n occur during its proper use.\n\n An adverse drug event (ADE) is defined as ‘Any untoward medical occurrence that may\n present during treatment with a medicine but which does not necessarily have a causal\n relationship with this treatment’.\n Two types of ADRs and their differentiating characteristics have been identified. The\n common, predictable, dose related reaction with low mortality is type ‘A’ ADR. For\n example, anticholinergic effect of tricyclic antidepressants and digoxin toxicity. ADRs\n may also be unrelated to the known pharmacological action of a drug. These are\n uncommon, non-dose related bizarre ‘B’ type reactions, for example, anaphylaxis with\n penicillins, malignant hyperthermia with halothane.\n Thalidomide marked the first recognized public health disaster related to the\n introduction of a new drug. It is now recognized that clinical trials, however through,\n cannot be guaranteed to detect all adverse effects likely to be caused by a drug. Health\n workers are thus encouraged to record and report to their national pharmacovigilance\n centre any unexpected adverse effects with any drug to achieve faster recognition of\n serious related problems. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO),\n Director General of Health Services under the influence of \n Welfare, has initiated a nationwide Pharmacovigilance programme for protecting the\n health of the patients by assuring drug safety.\n The specific aims and objectives of the National Pharmacovigilance Programme are:\n To monitor ADRs in Indian population.\n To create awareness amongst health care professionals about the importance of ADR\n reporting in India\n To ensure that the benefits of use of medicine outweighs the risks and thus safeguard\n the health of the Indian population\n To generate independent, evidence based recommendations on the safety of medicines\n\n 6",

    "text": "To encourage safe, rational and cost effective use of medicines.\nUnder the National Coordinating Center, several ADR monitoring centers operates to\ndetect ADEs. These ADR monitoring centers are located at MCI approved medical\ncolleges and hospitals, private hospitals, public health programmes, and autonomous\ninstitutions such as etc. The ADR monitoring centers\nrecord and analyze the ADEs and submit them to the National Coordinating center via\nonline reporting system known as Vigiflow.\nSpontaneous reporting\nSpontaneous reporting is the reporting of ADRs by healthcare professionals (and in some\ncountries consumers) to identify and report any suspected adverse drug reaction to a\npharmacovigilance center and/or to the manufacturer. It is one of the important methods\nof collecting information about ADRs.\nAll suspected adverse reactions, known or unknown, serious or otherwise should be\nreported. It is important to report even minor reactions of new drugs. For established\ndrugs, the reporting of serious ADRs is important. An increased frequency of a known\nADR to a drug is also important.\nAdverse drug reactions may be reported or notified to the nearest ADR monitoring centre\nunder the National Pharmacovigilance Program. The Department of Pharmacology, B. J.\nMedical College is one of the approved ADR monitoring center in Gujarat state. The\nADRs can be reported by the forms available at the department. Reporting is the process\nof providing ADR information by filling in the ADR form appropriately giving details of\nthe clinical case as well as the ADR ( Appendix – I).\nMajor factors predisposing to adverse drug effects\nIt is well known that different patients often respond differently to a given treatment\nregimen. For example, patients taking combinations of drugs known to interact, only a\nsmall number show any clinical evidence of interactions. In addition to the\npharmaceutical properties of drug therefore, there are characteristics of the patient which\npredispose to ADRs.\nExtremes of age: The very old and the very young are more susceptible to ADRs. Drugs\nwhich commonly cause problems in the elderly include hypnotics, diuretics, non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensives, psychotropics and digoxin.\nAll children and particularly neonates, differ from adults in their response to drugs. Some\ndrugs are likely to cause problems in neonates (for example morphine), but are generally\ntolerated in children. Other drugs (for example valproic acid) are associated with\nincreased risk of ADRs in children of all ages. Other drugs associated with problems in\nchildren include chloramphenicol (Grey baby syndrome), antiarrhythmics (worsening of\narrhythmias), acetylsalicylic acid (Reye syndrome).\nIntercurrent illness: If besides the condition being treated, the patient suffers from\nanother disease, such as kidney, liver or heart disease, special precautions may be\n\n 7",

The genetic make-up of the individual patient may also\n predispose to ADRs.\n Drug interactions: May occur between drugs which compete for the same receptor or act\n on the same physiological system. They may also occur indirectly when a drug-induced\n disease or a change in fluid or electrolyte balance alters the response to another drug.\n Incompatibilities between drugs and intravenous fluids\n Drugs should not be added to blood, amino acid solutions or fat emulsions. Certain drugs,\n when added to intravenous fluids, may be inactivated by pH changes, by precipitation or\n chemical reaction. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin lose potency after 6-8 hours if added\n to dextrose solutions, due to the acidity of the solutions. Some drugs bind to plastic\n containers and tubing, for example diazepam and insulin. Aminoglycosides are\n incompatible with penicillins and heparin. Hydrocortisone is incompatible with heparin,\n tetracycline and chloramphenicol.\n Adverse effects caused by traditional medicines\n Patients who have been or are taking traditional herbal remedies may develop ADRs. It is\n not always easy to identify the responsible plant or plant constituent. Refer to the drug\n and toxicology information service if available or to suitable literature.\n The effect of food on drug absorption\n Food delays gastric emptying and reduces the rate of absorption of many drugs; the total\n amount of drug absorbed may or may not be reduced. However, some drugs are\n preferably taken with food, either to increase absorption or to decrease the irritant effect\n on the stomach.\n\nVI.Prescription writing\n A prescription is an instruction from a prescriber to a dispenser. Every country has its\n own standards for the minimum information required for a prescription, and its own laws\n and regulations to define which drugs require a prescription and who is entitled to write it.\n Many countries have separate regulations for prescriptions for controlled drugs such as\n opioid analgesics. The following guidelines will help to ensure that prescriptions are\n correctly interpreted and leave no doubt the intension of the prescriber. The guidelines are\n relevant for primary care prescribing; they may, however, be adapted for use in hospitals\n or other specialist units.\n Prescription form\n The most important requirement is that the prescription be clear and legible and indicate\n precisely what should be given. The local language may be preferred.\n The following details should be shown on the form:\n The prescriber’s name, address and telephone number. This will allow either the\n patient or the dispenser to contact the prescriber for any clarification or potential\n problem with the prescription.\n\n 8",

In children, CPA is not sudden but end result of long\nperiod of hypoxaemia secondary to inadequate ventilation, oxygenation or circulation. Therefore,\nprompt management of these is essential to prevent CPA, the outcome of which is poor.\nDiagnosis of cardiopulmonary and cardiac arrest\n1. Absence of pulse in major arteries (carotid or femoral in older children and\n femoral or brachial in infants as carotid is difficult to palpate due to short neck).\n2. Absence of heart sounds on auscultation.\n3. Asystole /ventricular fibrillation on ECG.\nRespiratory arrest\nAbsence of respiration on examination (absent chest movements), listening (absent air flow on\nbringing ears in front of mouth) and feeling (absent air flow on keeping hands in front of mouth\nor nose).\nLevels of CPR\nBasic life support (BLS): The elements of CPR are provided without additional equipment.\nSkill and speed are most essential.\nAdvanced cardiac life support (ACLS): Use of equipment and drugs for assisting ventilation\nor circulation.\nPrimary survey to assess the patient's condition:\n Tap the patient on the shoulder and ask, \"Are you all right?\"\n If the patient does not respond, call for help.\n Give 2 minutes (5 cycles) of CPR before leaving patient to call for help.\n Check for pulse or any other signs of life; begin CPR, 30 compressions to 2 respirations\n (push hard and fast--100/minute and release chest completely).\n Open airway and check for breathing. Give 2 breaths that make the chest rise.\n Start an IV line.\n Begin oxygen.\n Attach a monitor\n Intravenous / Intra osseous (IO) access is a priority over advanced airway management. If an\n advanced airway is placed, change to continuous chest compressions without pauses for\n breaths. Give 8 to 10 breaths per minute and check rhythm every 2 minutes.\n\n 47",

The conventional and easy method of evaluating\n disturbances in fluid and electrolyte balance is the frequent measurement of the concentration\n of serum electrolytes. It is crucial to remember that intracellular and extracellular electrolytes\n are normally constant, and that major shifts in and out of 'compartments' can occur in disease\n with minimal changes in serum electrolyte. Compositional changes also involve disturbances\n in acid-base balance.\nI. Volume deficit\n Obvious causes\n Vomiting, diarrhoea, intestinal fistulae, nasogastric suction, fluid loss following burns,\n sequestration of fluid in soft tissue injuries and infections, diuretics, renal disease/adrenal\n insufficiency\n Less obvious causes\n Inadequate fluid intake, fluid loss through excessive sweating as in high fever, hot humid\n temperature, haemodialysis, haemofiltration from surgical incisions and tetanus\n Treatment\n The first principle is to restore circulating volume through infusion of intravenous fluids.\n Once this is satisfactorily achieved, disturbances in electrolytes and acid-base balance if\n present need to be rectified. Various fluids used for volume replacement are given below:\n Replacement fluids\n Replacement fluids are used to replace abnormal loss of blood, plasma or other\n extracellular fluids as first line treatment for hypovolemia in:\n - Patients with established hypovolemia e.g. haemorrhagic shock.\n - Maintenance of normovolaemia in patients with ongoing fluid losses e.g. surgical\n blood loss.\n Intravenous replacement fluids are the first line of treatment for hypovolemia.\n Crystalloid maintenance fluids, which contain dextrose, are not suitable for use as\n replacement fluids. However, crystalloid solutions with a similar concentration of\n sodium to plasma (normal saline or balanced salt) solutions (Ringer's lactate or\n Hartmann's solutions) are effective as replacement fluids. These should be available in\n all hospitals where intravenous replacement fluids are used. Crystalloids should be\n infused in a volume at least three times the volume lost in order to correct hypovolemia.\n All colloid solutions (albumins, dextran, gelatins and hydroxyethyl starch solutions) are\n replacement fluids. However, they have not been shown to be superior to crystalloids in\n resuscitation.

Hypothermia is more often seen in patients\n at the extremes of age and in immunocompromised patients.\n Other signs include tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, tachypnea, and hypotension.\n Mental status changes ranging from mild disorientation to coma are commonly seen.\n Ophthalmic manifestations include retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and\n conjunctival petechiae.\n Cardiovascular manifestations initially include vasodilation, resulting in warm\n extremities.\n Cardiac output is maintained early in sepsis through a compensatory tachycardia. As\n sepsis progresses, hypotension may occur. Patients in septic shock may demonstrate a\n diminished response to volume replacement.\n Renal manifestations include azotemia, oliguria, and active urinary sediment due to\n acute tubular necrosis.\n Hepatic dysfunction present as cholestatic jaundice, increases in transaminases, alkaline\n phosphatase, and S.bilirubin. Painless mucosal erosions may occur in the stomach and\n duodenum and cause upper GI bleeds.\n Skin findings include cellulitis, erysipelas, and fasciitis. Hypotension and disseminated\n intravascular coagulation (DIC) can also produce skin changes, including acrocyanosis\n and necrosis of peripheral tissues.\n Hematologic changes include neutropenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and DIC.\n Thrombocytopenia occurs in over 30 percent of patients with sepsis. DIC is more often\n associated with gram-negative sepsis. Decompensated DIC presents with clinical\n bleeding and thrombosis. Laboratory studies can show thrombocytopenia, prolonged\n prothrombin time (PT) and partial prothromboplastin time (PTT), decreased fibrinogen\n level and antithrombin levels, and increased fibrin monomer, fibrin split values, and Ddimer values.\n Hyperglycemia may be the result of increased catecholamines, cortisol, and glucagon.\n Increased insulin resistance, decreased insulin production, and impaired utilization of\n insulin may further contribute to hyperglycemia.\n Arterial blood gas (ABG) studies in early sepsis may reveal hypoxemia and respiratory\n alkalosis. As perfusion worsens and glycolysis increases, a metabolic acidosis results.\n\nNon pharmacological treatment\n Aggressive airway management with high-flow oxygen and endotracheal intubation\n Rapid infusion of crystalloid IV fluid (Ringer’s lactate or normal saline) at 500 ml (20\n ml/kg in children) every 5 to 10 min; 4 to 6 L (60 ml/kg in children)",

Most of the fatalities are\ndue to the victim not reaching the hospital in time where definite treatment can be\nadministered.\nSnakes in India\nThere are about 236 species of snakes in India, most of which are non-poisonous, however,\nthere are 13 known species that are poisonous and four of these, namely Indian cobra,\nRussell's viper, saw- scaled viper and Indian krait are highly venomous and are believed to be\nresponsible for most of the poisonous bites in India\n Salient features\n Viper envenomization (haemovasculotoxic): swelling and local pain, tender\n enlargement of local lymph nodes, bleeding from any orifice,epistaxis, vomiting,\n hypotension, petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses\n Elapid envenomization (neurotoxic): swelling and local pain, local necrosis and\n blistering, descending paralysis, ptosis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, paralysis of\n jaw and tongue, numbness around the lip and mouth, inadequate ventilation,\n paradoxical respiration.\n\nInvestigations\n Identification of snake, local swelling within few minutes after bite is an important sig of\n viper envenomization.\n Blood stained sputum and non clotting of blood are diagnostic criteria for Russel viper\n and Saw scaled viper poisoning.\n Ptosis and glossopharyngeal palsy are diagnostic criteria for Cobra and Indian Krait\n poisoning.\n Investigations include\n - 20 minute whole blood clotting test\n - Hb/ platelet count/ peripheral smear/ PT/ APTT/ FDP/ D-Dimer\n - Urine examination for proteinuria/RBC/ hemoglobinuria/ myoglobinuria\n - Serum creatinine/ urea/ potassium\n - Oxygen saturation/ PR/BP/ RR/ postural blood pressure\n - ECG/ X-Ray/ CT/ ultrasound (the use of X-Ray and ultrasound are of unproven\n benefit, apart from identification of bleeding in viperine bites).\n - ELISA to confirm snake species\nTreatment\nFirst aid measures (RIGHT approach)\nR: reassure patient and control anxiety\nI: immobilize bitten part by splinting the limb",

In India polyvalent ASV is\n available which is effective against all the four common species. ASV should be\n administered only when there are definite signs of envenomation i.e. coagulopathy or\n neurotoxicity\n Mild and severe envenomation requires 8 to 10 vials. Each vial is 10 ml of reconstituted\n ASV. Children should receive the same ASV dosage as adults. ASV should be\n administered over 1 hour at constant speed and patient should be closely monitored for 2\n hours.\n ASV reactions: Anaphylaxis may be life-threatening. if anaphylaxis is evident, ASV\n should be discontinued. Inj. hydrocortisone 100 mg + antihistamine or Inj. adrenaline\n subcutaneously can be administered for ASV reaction\n Repeat dose of 5-10 vials of ASV i.e. half to one full dose, should continue 6 hourly till\n coagulation is restored unless a species is identified against which polyvalent ASV is\n ineffective. Only for snakes which inject massive amounts of venom, such as the King\n Cobra or Australian elapids, massive doses of 50+ vials are required.\nFollow up\nA snakebite victim discharged within 24 hrs should be advised to return if there is any\nworsening of symptoms or signs such as bleeding, pain or swelling at the site of bite,\ndifficulty in breathing, altered sensorium etc. Explain about the signs and symptoms of serum\nsickness which may manifest after 5-10 days.\n\n INSECT AND ARACHNID BITES\nInsect arachnid (spider, scorpion) bites and stings are common and usually cause minor\nirritation. However, some stings can be painful and trigger a serious allergic reaction.\n Salient features\n Skin around the bite becomes red, swollen and itchy. The venom from a sting often\n causes a swollen, itchy, red mark (a weal) to form on the skin. This can be painful and\n itchy for a few days, but is harmless in most cases. They can usually be treated at\n home.\n The severity of bites and stings varies depending on the type of insect and sensitivity\n of the person. In rare cases, some people can have a serious allergic reaction\n (anaphylaxis) to a bite or sting that requires immediate medical treatment.",

Paraplegia or quadriplegia maybe caused by lesions of cerebrum, spinal cord,\n motor roots, peripheral nerves, myoneural junction or muscles. The lesions of the\n spinal cord may be compressive or non-compressive.\n\nPharmacological treatment\n The treatment depends on the underlying etiology. E.g. compressive myelopathies usually\n require urgent surgical intervention.\n Indications for corticosteroids in paraplegia: neoplastic spinal cord compression,\n traumatic spinal cord injuries, acute transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis\n optica, sarcoid myelitis, ADEM. The dose is Inj. methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3-5 days.\n Continuation of steroids depends on the underlying cause.\n Fever: The loss of normal thermoregulation and inability to maintain normal body\n temperature can produce recurrent fever (quadriplegic fever), although most episodes of\n fever are due to infection of the urinary tract, lung, skin, or bone.\n Bladder dysfunction: It generally results from loss of supraspinal innervation of the\n detrusor muscle of the bladder wall and the sphincter musculature.\n - Detrusor spasticity is treated with anticholinergic drugs like Tab. oxybutynin 2.5–5\n mg QID or tricyclic antidepressants that have anticholinergic properties, Tab.\n imipramine, 25–200 mg/d.\n - Failure of the sphincter muscle to relax during bladder emptying (urinary\n dyssynergia) may be managed with the adrenergic blocking agent Tab. terazosin\n hydrochloride 1–2 mg TDS or QID, with intermittent catheterization, or, if that is not\n feasible, by use of a condom catheter in men or a permanent indwelling catheter.\n - Bladder areflexia due to acute spinal shock or conus lesions is best treated by\n catheterization.\n - Surgical options include the creation of an artificial bladder.\n Bowel regimens and disimpaction are necessary in most patients to ensure at least\n biweekly evacuation and avoid colonic distention or obstruction.\n During the first 2 weeks, use of calf-compression devices and anticoagulation with Inj.\n heparin 5000 U SC every 12 h or Tab. warfarin (INR, 2–3) are recommended.

However, a diagnosis of GERD based on the\n presence of typical symptoms is correct in only 70% of patients.\n In addition to these typical symptoms, abnormal reflux can cause atypical\n (extraesophageal) symptoms, such as coughing, chest pain, and wheezing.\n For patients with symptoms and history consistent with uncomplicated GERD, the\n diagnosis of GERD may be assumed and empirical therapy begun. Patients who show\n signs of GERD complications or other illness or who do not respond to therapy should be\n considered for further diagnostic testing.\nInvestigations\n Upper GI endoscopy - Endoscopy can help confirm the diagnosis of reflux by\n demonstrating complications of reflux (esophagitis, strictures, Barrett oesophagus) and\n can help in evaluating the anatomy (e.g., hiatal hernia, masses, strictures)\n Manometry helps surgical planning by determining the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)\n pressure and identifying any oesophageal motility disorders.\n Optional studies include: 24-hour pH probe test and nuclear medicine gastric emptying\n study\nTreatment\n\n 131",

Standard microbiologic biochemical testing for Enterobacteriaceae will suffice for\n identification of V. cholerae. All vibrios are oxidase-positive.\n A point-of-care antigen-detection cholera dipstick assay is now commercially available\n for use in the field or where laboratory facilities are lacking.\nNon- pharmacological treatment\n ORS may be made by adding safe water to prepackaged sachets containing salts and\n sugar or by adding 0.5 teaspoon of table salt (NaCl; 3.5 g) and 4 tablespoons of table\n sugar (glucose; 40 g) to 1 L of safe water.\n Potassium intake in bananas or green coconut water should be encouraged.\nPharmacological treatment\n Euvolemia should first be rapidly restored, and adequate hydration should then be\n maintained to replace ongoing fluid losses (Table 1& 2).\n WHO recommends \"low-osmolarity\" ORS for treatment of dehydrating diarrhea. If\n available, rice-based ORS is considered superior to standard ORS in the treatment of\n cholera. ORS can be administered via a nasogastric tube to individuals who cannot ingest\n fluid.\n Optimal management for severe dehydration includes the administration of IV fluid and\n electrolytes. Ringer's lactate is the best choice among commercial products. It must be\n used with additional potassium supplements, preferably given by mouth. The total fluid\n deficit in severely dehydrated patients (>10% of body weight) can be replaced safely\n within the first 3–6 h of therapy, half within the first hour. Transient muscle cramps and\n tetany are common. Thereafter, oral therapy can usually be initiated, with the goal of\n maintaining fluid intake equal to fluid output.\n Patients with continued large-volume diarrhea may require prolonged IV treatment to\n match gastrointestinal fluid losses. Severe hypokalemia can develop but will respond to\n potassium given either IV or orally. In the absence of adequate staff to monitor the\n patient's progress, the oral route of rehydration and potassium replacement is safer than\n the IV route.\n Table 1.

The worm is located in the large intestine.\n Salient features\n Most individuals are asymptomatic. Features of pulmonary involvement because of larval\n migration include irritating nonproductive cough, bronchospasm or pneumonitis and burring\n substernal discomfort aggravated by coughing or deep inspiration, dyspnoea, fever,\n eosinophilic pneumonities.\n Small bowel obstruction may get complicated by perforation intussusceptions or volvulus.\n Aberrant migration of a large worm may cause biliary colic, cholangitis, cholecystitis\n pancreatic and oral expulsion of the worm.\n\n Pharmacological treatment\n Tab mebendazole 100 mg 12 hourly for 3 days in children above 2 years of age. (Caution:\n contraindicated in children < 2 years)\n Tab. pyrantel pamoate 11 mg/kg as a single dose or Tab. albendazole 400 mg as a single\n dose.

Adult pinworm is around 1 cm\n long and dwells in the bowel lumen in the small and large intestine around caecum area.\n Salient features\n Most infestations are asymptomatic. Cardinal symptoms are perianal pruritis, worse at night\n due to migration of female worms. Excessive itching can lead to perianal excoriation and\n bacterial superinfection. Heavy infection causes abdominal pain and weight loss.\n Rarely, in female’s vulvovaginitis and pelvic or peritoneal granulomas occur. Eosinophilia.\n\n 153",

Patients may experience mild headache, eye ache and visual field defect\n in late cases.\n Reading and close work often present increasing difficulties owing to accommodative\n failure due to constant pressure on the ciliary muscle and its nerve supply. Therefore,\n patients usually complain of frequent changes in presbyopic glasses.\n Ocular examination including slit-lamp biomicroscopy may reveal normal anterior\n segment. In late stages pupil reflex becomes sluggish and cornea may show slight haze.\n In the initial stages the IOP may not be raised permanently, but there is an exaggeration\n of the normal diurnal variation. Therefore, repeated observations of IOP (every 3-4hour),\n for 24 hours is required during this stage (Diurnal variation test). Applanation tonometry\n should be preferred over Schiotz tonometry.\n Gonioscopy reveals open angles. Optic disc changes are typically progressive,\n asymmetric and present a variety of characteristic clinical patterns. It is essential,\n therefore, to record the appearance of the nerve head in such a way that will accurately\n reveal subtle glaucomatous changes over the course of follow-up period.\n\nInvestigations\n Perimetry to detect the visual field defects.\n Nerve fibre layer analysis and disc topography analysis to detect early damage and for\n progression analysis.\nPharmacological treatment\n Identification of target pressure. From the baseline evaluation data a ‘target pressure’\n should be identified for each patient. Progression of disease is uncommon if IOP is\n maintained at less than 16 to 18 mm of Hg in patients having mild to moderate damage\n and 10 to 12 mmHg in patients with severe damage.\n Single drug therapy. One topical antiglaucoma drug should be chosen after due\n consideration to the patient’s personal and medical factors. If the initial drug chosen is\n ineffective or intolerable, it should be replaced by the drug of second choice.\n\n 181",

It is the sixth leading cause of blindness in\n the world. Risk factors include increased duration of diabetes, uncontrolled diabetes,\n abnormal lipid profile, smoking, renal disease etc.\n Non- pharmacological treatment\n Early diagnosis, proper diabetic control, regular follow up and fundus examination are\n important. In certain cases laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy surgery can help.\n Pharmacological treatment\n No tested or proven pharmacological treatment exists which can delay, prevent or\n curdiabetic retinopathy.\n Patient education\n Explain the importance of yearly fundus examination. Laser treatment can prevent\n deterioration of vision but cannot correct existing visual defects.\n RETINAL DETACHMENT\n Retinal detachment (RD) is the separation of the sensory retina from retinal pigment\n epithelium. It may be localized or entire retina may be involved. Retinal detachment that\n includes the macula results in significant visual loss. The three types are Rhegmatogenous\n RD, exudative RD and tractional RD.\n Salient features\n Rhegmatogenous RD is characterized by formation of a tear in the retina. Symptoms include\n flashes of light, presence of floaters in visual field and loss of central vision, if macula is\n involved. The diagnosis is done by examination of the fundus with indirect ophthalmoscopy.\n The retina appears grey wit oscillating folds.\n Tractional RD is caused by gliotic bands on retina.\n Exudative RD is caused by collection of serous fluid between neurosensory retina and retinal\n pigment epithelium.\n\n Non- pharmacological treatment\n Treatment of choice is reattachment surgery involving identification of all retinal breaks\n areas of vitreous or retinal tractions and induction of aspectic chorioretinal inflammation\n around the breaks to seal them.\n Ensuring chorioretinal apposition by approximating choroid/retinal pigment epithelium to\n neurosensory retina by external tamponade, internal tamponade and drainage of subretinal\n fluid\n Adhesion between retinal pigment epithelium and retina can be achieved by cryotherapy,\n diathermy or photocoagulation.\n\n Pharmacological treatment\n 190",

Repeat once a year.\n- Use proper lighting. Eliminate exterior light by closing drapes, shades or blinds. Reduce\n interior lighting by using lower intensity bulbs and tubes.\n- Minimize glare: To install an anti-glare screen on your monitor. Paint bright white walls a\n darker color with a matt finish.\n- Upgrade your display. Use LCD monitor instead of a CRT monitor.\n- Adjust the brightness and contrast of your computer screen.\n- Blink more often.\n- Exercise your eyes: Follow 20-20-20 rule i.e. after every 20 minutes, look at 20 feet\n distance for 20 seconds.\n- Take frequent breaks - two 15-minute breaks -four additional five-minute \"minibreaks\"\n throughout the work day (6-8 hrs).\n- Modify your workstation. Proper posture during computer work. Position computer\n screen 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The center of your screen should be about 10 to 15\n degrees below your eyes. Top of the screen tilted back slightly (10-20 degree) away from\n the operator.\n- Consider customized eyeglasses specific for use during work on a computer screen.

For second trimester MTP medical methods are\n preferred.\n Methods are usually combined so as to increase the success rate and to shorten induction\n abortion interval. Most commonly extra amniotic 0.1% ethacridine lactate 10 ml per week\n of gestation (maximum 150 ml) with IV oxytocin after 6-24 hours or IM 15 methyl\n PGF2α. Abortion is induced in 32 – 36 hours with a success rate of 75-80%.\n Better results if some method for cervical ripening is used 6 - 12 hours before.\n If some method fails switch over to other method or surgical method\n\n ANEMIA IN PREGNANCY\nPrevalence of anaemia in pregnancy in India is 80% and severe anaemia is 10-15%. Causes\nof anaemia in pregnancy are the same as those encountered in the non pregnant state.\nHowever, iron deficiency anaemia is commonest in pregnancy. In about 40-50% of cases\nthere is associated folic acid deficiency. Anaemia in pregnancy is defined as haemoglobin\nconcentration of less than 11 g/dl and haematocrit of less than 33%. It is further classified\ndepending on Hb levels as mild 10-11 g%, moderate 7-10 g% and severe <7 g%.\n\n 236",

It is a major cause of maternal\nmorbidity, mortality and perinatal loss. APH is due to placental cause in as high as 70% cases\nand in 25-30% of cases cause may remain undetermined.\n Salient features\n Clinical presentation varies depending on the severity of blood loss and cause of\n bleeding\n In mild haemorrhage there may be no maternal or foetal compromise, while massive\n haemorrhage can lead to hypovolaemic shock, coagulation failure, renal failure, foetal\n distress and may result in maternal and foetal death.\n Ultrasound is confirmatory for placenta praevia.\n\n 247",

The baby should not be given\n any other food or drink before breastfeeding.\n Babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life.\n Breast milk contains exactly the nutrients a baby needs, is easily digested and protects the\n baby against infection.\n\n INDUCTION AND AUGMENTATION OF LABOUR\nInduction of labour refers to stimulating the uterus to begin labour. While augmentation of\nlabour means stimulating the uterus during labour to increase the frequency, duration and\nstrength of contractions.\n\n 259",

    "text": "A good labour pattern is established when there are three contractions in 10 minutes, each\nlasting more than 40 seconds. If the membranes are intact, it is recommended practice in both\ninduction and augmentation of labour to first perform artificial rupture of membranes (ARM).\nIn some cases, this is all that is needed to induce labour. Membrane rupture, whether\nspontaneous or artificial, often sets off the following chain of events:\n - Amniotic fluid is expelled;\n - Uterine volume is decreased;\n - Prostaglandins are produced, stimulating labour;\n - Uterine contractions begin (if the woman is not in labour) or become stronger (if she is\n already in labour).\nArtificial rupture of membranes\n Note: In areas where HIV and/or hepatitis are highly prevalent, it is prudent to leave the\n membranes intact for as long as possible to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV\n Monitor the fetal heart rate.\n Ask the woman to lie on her back with her legs bent, feet together and knees apart.\n Wearing sterile gloves, use one hand to examine the cervix and note the consistency,\n position, effacement and dilatation.\n Use the other hand to insert an amniotic hook or a Kocher clamp into the vagina.\n Guide the clamp or hook towards the membranes along the fingers in the vagina.\n Place two fingers against the membranes and gently rupture the membranes with the\n instrument in the other hand. Allow the amniotic fluid to drain slowly around the fingers.\n Note the colour of the fluid (clear, greenish, bloody). If thick meconium is present,\n suspect fetal distress.\n After ARM, listen to the fetal heart rate during and after a contraction. If the fetal heart\n rate is abnormal (less than 100 or more than 180 beats per minute), suspect fetal distress.\n If membranes have been ruptured for 18 hours, give prophylactic antibiotics to help\n reduce Group B streptococcus infection in the neonate - penicillin G 2 million units IV; ,\n or Inj. ampicillin 2 g IV, every six hours until delivery\n If good labour is not established one hour after ARM, begin oxytocin infusion\n If labour is induced because of severe maternal disease (e.g. sepsis or eclampsia), begin\n oxytocin infusion at the same time as ARM.\nAssessment of the cervix\n The success of induction of labour is related to the condition of the cervix at the start of\n induction. To assess the condition of the cervix, a cervical exam is performed and a score\n is assigned based on the criteria (Table 5):\n If the cervix is favourable (has a score of 6 or more), labour is usually successfully\n induced with oxytocin alone.\n If the cervix is unfavourable (has a score of 5 or less), ripen the cervix using\n prostaglandins or a Foley catheter before induction.\n\n 260",

Less severe bleeding (haemodynamically stable patient)\n High dose progestogen: norethisterone 10 mg 3 times a day until bleeding stops (not >3\n days) followed by norethisterone 5-10 mg or medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg per\n day for 21 days. Withdrawal bleeding occurs after 2-4 days of stopping the drug and\n stops in 4-5 days. Or combined oral contraceptive pills (OCs) containing 50 mcg\n ethinyloestradiol 1 pill 2 times a day for 7 - 10 days followed by progestins for 7-10 days,\n followed by withdrawal bleeding.\nIII. If bleeding is not controlled with progestogens\nPatient is having heavy bleeding for many days, endometrial curettage yields minimal\ntissue, or when the patient has been on progestogen medication (OC's or Depot MPA) and\nthe endometrium is shallow and atrophic.\nTreatment schedules of high dose oestrogens, depending on the severity of the bleeding the\nfollowing can be used:\n 1.

The\nawareness, regarding the nature of mental illnesses and the need for treatment, and their\nacceptance is also improving. Although psychopharmacology forms the backbone of\ntreatment in most psychiatric disorders, certain points need to be especially emphasized while\nmanaging psychiatric patients:\n1) The formation of a trusting, confidential, non-judgemental and empathetic doctor - patient\n relationship is crucial to the practice of psychiatry.\n2) Knowing the person as a whole rather than only his symptoms endorses patient\n improvement.\n3) The psychotic patient often loses his judgement and reality perception. Such patients\n often have to be treated against their will.\n4) Family has an important role in the causation and management of psychiatric disorders.\n5) All patients do well with holistic treatment which includes psychopharmacology, other\n biological treatments, psychotherapy and rehabilitation.\n6) Psychiatric treatment often continues for a long period, so compliance is a major issue.\n\n SCHIZOPHRENIA AND OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS\nSchizophrenia is a chronic debilitating psychiatric disorder of varied and profoundly\ndisruptive psychopathology affecting cognition, perception, emotion and other aspects of\nbehavior. Its usual age of presentation is around 25 yrs and affects all social classes equally.\n Salient features\n The common symptoms of schizophrenia are false, fixed, firm beliefs (delusion),\n perceptual abnormalities e.g. hearing of voices while alone (hallucinations).\n Abnormalities in speech and behavior as irrelevant speech, talking to self, crying or\n laughing for no reason are also prominent.\n schizophrenia has been divided into following subtypes for the ease of practice.\n - Paranoid schizophrenia- Delusions and hallucinations form predominant features\n along with other symptoms.\n - Catatonic schizophrenia-Characterized by marked psychomotor retardation or\n agitation.\n - Hebephrenic schizophrenia-Characterized by marked abnormalities of behavior.\n - Residual schizophrenia Simple schizophrenia\nNon- pharmacological treatment\n Cognitive behaviorally oriented psychotherapy - understanding of illness, identification of\n target symptoms, and development of strategies to cope up with these symptoms.\n\n 284",

A variety of orthotic (splints)\n and assistive devices (cane, walker) can be helpful in supporting and aligning deformed\n joints to reduce pain and improve function.\n Pharmacological treatment\n In acute inflammation any of the NSAIDs as given in section on osteoarthritis may be\n given except paracetamol. The anti-inflammatory action of the NSAIDs may take 2-4\n weeks to become evident. Evaluation of persistent polyarthritis.\n Reduced NSAID dosages have to be used in the elderly and in patients with impaired\n renal function. Concomitant use of more than one NSAID only increases toxicity, and has\n no additional benefit. Patient not responding to one NSAID may still show a good\n response to another.\n Topical applications- containing salicylates, capsaicin, nicotinates, menthol, camphor and\n NSAIDs in various combinations may provide symptomatic relief.\n Refer to a specialist (physician) at a higher centre. Begin disease modifying antirheumatic\n drugs (DMARD) early in the disease. Prediction of response to a particular DMARD is\n not possible. It takes 4-6 weeks to show its effect.\n Tab. methotrexate 7.5 mg to 15 mg every week. Concomitant Tab. folic acid 1\n mg/day reduces side effects.\n Caution: Nausea, mouth sores, liver damage, increases in incidence of chest infection,\n macrocytic anaemia. Regular monitoring of LFT is required. Avoid alcohol during\n therapy\n For patients with severe disease, affecting activities of daily living and\n not responding to adequate trial of NSAIDs and DMARD for sufficient\n duration consider following treatment,\n\n 310",

The factors that must be considered in preoperative assessment are\n The disease (and its extent) for which the surgery is planned.\n The condition of the patient, organ system.\n The relative urgency of the surgery.\n The type of surgery and its alternatives.\n The relative morbidity and mortality of the disease and the surgical procedure.\n All these factors are interdependent and this assessment is the most fundamental task to\n be performed in a surgical patient. Surgeon may at times, need the help of a physician,\n cardiologist or anesthetist, to take the right decision. The preoperative assessment should\n also include discussion on drugs being taken by the patient and documentation of known\n allergies.\nInformed consent\nInformed consent should be taken after a detailed discussion by the surgeon (or his\nresponsible assistant)with the patient and his close relatives ,informing them about the nature\nof the procedure planned, benefits expected, risks involved and possible alternatives, giving\nfull opportunity to them to ask questions and clear doubts.\nPreoperative preparation\n Routine investigations Hb, TLC, DLC, CT, BT, urine routine examination, and in patients\n over 30 years, chest X-ray and ECG should be done.\n Special and specific investigations depending upon the nature of the procedure planned\n and the physical condition of the patient for evaluating fitness for surgery.\n Lipstick, nail polish and other cosmetics which may mask cyanosis and interfere with\n pulse oximetry should be removed.\n Dentures, spectacles, contact lenses, artificial limbs, artificial eyes, hearing aid and\n jewellery, cash and mobile phones should be removed before shifting the patient to\n operation theatre.\n\n 317",

Throughout this guideline the term surgical site\n infection (SSl) is used, unless the evidence relates specifically to surgical wound\n infection.\n\n SURGICAL SITE INFECTION\nCriteria for defining a surgical site infection (SSI)\nSuperficial incisional SSI\n Infection occurs within 30 day after the operation and infection involves only skin of\n subcutaneous tissue of the incision and at least one of the following\n Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision\n Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the\n superficial incision.\n At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: Pain or tenderness, localized\n swelling, redness, heat and superficial incision is deliberately opened by a surgeon,\n unless, incision is culture-negative\n Diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician\nDeep incisional SSI\n Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within\n one year if implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation and\n infection involves deep soft tissues (e.g. fascial and muscle layers)of the incision and at\n least one of the following\nPurulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the\n surgical site.\nA deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the\n patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38°C) localized pain\n tenderness unless site is culture-negative\nAn abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct\n examination,during re-operation,or by histopathologyor radiologic examination.\n\n 321",

Antibiotics\n election is influenced by the organism most commonly causing wound. Infection in the\n specific procedure and by the relative costs of available agents.\n Gastrointestinal procedures, oral and intravenous administration of agents with activity\n against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are warranted, as well as mechanical\n preparation of the bowel. Ceftriaxone/cefotaxime provides adequate coverage for most\n other types of procedures. The antibiotics chosen for prophylaxis can be those used for\n active treatment of infection. However, the chosen antibiotics must reflect local diseasespecific information about the common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility.\n A past history of a serious adverse event should preclude administration of a particular\n antibiotic like penicillin.\nTiming and duration of prophylaxis\n The first dose should always be given before the procedure, preferably within 30 minutes\n before incision. Re-administration at one to two half-lives of the antibiotic is\n recommended for the duration of the procedure. In general, postoperative administration\n is not recommended.\n There may be situations where overriding factors alter the normal timing of\n administration. For example, during a caesarean section prophylaxis should be delayed\n until the cord is clamped in order to prevent the drug reaching the neonate. When a\n tourniquet is to be applied the necessary tissue concentration must be achieved prior to its\n application rather than the time of incision. This probably occurs within10 minutes of\n administration of an IV antibiotic injection. Antibiotics should also be administered\n immediately after unexpected contamination of the tissues additional doses during the\n operation.\n The individual surgeon should be free to give an extra dose for prolonged operations with\n major blood loss if they wish. However, there is insufficient evidence to make a general\n recommendation. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be confined to the peri operative period.\n\n 322",

If the baby is preterm, meconium stained or some evidence of infection, not\n crying or breathing or with poor muscle tone, then proceed to initial steps of resuscitation.\n For term babies, use 100% oxygen when baby is cyanotic or when positive pressure\n ventilation is required. If room air is being used, supplementary oxygen should be\n available to use if there is no appreciable improvement within 90 seconds of birth. If\n supplemental oxygen is not available, positive pressure ventilation should be continued\n with room air.\n Infants without signs of life (no heart beat and no respiratory effort) after 10 minutes of\n resuscitation show either a high mortality or severe neurodevelopmental disability. After\n 10 minutes of continuous and adequate resuscitative efforts, discontinuation of\n resuscitation may be justified if there are no signs of life.\nHypothermia\n Identification of hypothermia. An axillary (or rectal) temperature <36.0°C is\n hypothermia. Such a baby would feel cold to touch on the abdomen and periphery.\n Identification of cold stress: Baby's peripheries are cold but abdomen is warm. This\n usually corresponds to axillary temperature of 36-36.4°C.\n Prevention of hypothermia.\n- Dry the baby with warm dry linen at birth. Discard wet linen and wrap in dry linen.\nPlace baby after birth under a radiant warmer or 200 Watt bulb (placed at a distance of 45 cm\nabove the baby). If neither is available, place the newborn infant on the mother's chest\n\n 365",

However,\n baby may be wiped with warm clean water to remove dried blood, vernix or secretions.\n Care must be taken to ensure that the room is warm and draught free when the baby is\n being cleaned or bathed. The baby should immediately be wrapped in dry linen after\n being wiped dry.\n After birth and for the first few days thereafter keep mother and baby in close proximity\n with baby being adequately clothed. In cold weather, the baby must have 2 layers of\n cotton vest with a woolen sweater, cap, socks and legs should be covered and baby should\n be wrapped in a blanket. In summer, cotton dress with a cotton diaper wrapped in a\n cotton cloth.\nPrevention of infection\n Always clean hands with soap and water and wear sterile gloves if available before\n conducting the birth of the baby and while examining babies during the first few days of\n life.\n A sterilized blade (if that is not available a new razor blade or a blade boiled for at least\n 20 minutes) must be used for cutting the cord at delivery. The cord tie used must be\n sterile or boiled for 20 minutes before used for tying the cord after birth.\n The surface for conducting delivery and placing the baby after birth must be clean.\n Do not apply anything to the cord or eyes after birth.\n Do not give prelacteal feeds. Give exclusive breast-feeding from birth.\nExclusive breastfeeding\n Advise mothers to start breast feeding within one hour of birth. Not to give any prelacteal\n feeds such as honey, water, etc.\n Give breast feeds to baby on demand. Give the baby exclusive breast feeding for at least\n first 6 months of life. However, there may be situations where it may not be possible to\n provide human milk i.e., maternal death, severe maternal illness, HIV positive mothers\n and documented lactational inadequacy.\n Not to give water to the baby during period of exclusive breast feeding.\nEarly identification of high-risk newborns\n Babies born to mothers with eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage, diabetes etc. are\n considered as high-risk newborns and delivery should be conducted at a centre where all\n facilities for the care of the newborn are available. The following examination at birth or\n during the first few days would help detect high risk babies who are in need of immediate\n referral to an appropriate health facility which has adequate newborn care.\n\n 366",

Provision of maintenance requirements for normal\nmetabolism, correction of ongoing losses (diarrhea, vomiting) or removal (suction,\naspiration). The maintenance requirements are as follows:\nA guideline for estimating daily fluid and electrolyte requirement in a normal child under\nnormal conditions is:\nWeight Fluid requirement\n3-10 kg 100 ml/kg/day\n10-20 kg 1000 ml + 50 ml/kg/day for each kg above 10.\n> 20 kg 1500 ml + 20 ml/kg/day for each kg above 20.\n\nMaintenance fluid requirement replaces water loss through skin (2/3 of losses), GIT,\nrespiration, and urine. These losses are affected by ambient humidity, clothing, body\ntemperature, respiratory rate, and age of the child. Situation specific adjustments are\nnecessary when calculating maintenance fluids. The most commonly employed intravenous\nmaintenance fluid employed in children is N/5 (0.18%) sodium chloride in 5% glucose +\npotassium chloride 20 mEq/ Liter. Commercially it is available as Isolyte P, Kidral etc.\nMaintenance requirements in newborns\nThe following table provides the normal fluid electrolyte requirements in newborn babies.\n\n Table 4.

Severe cases may present with CCF.\n Iron deficiency is uncommon in term breastfed children but prematurity, perinatal\n blood loss or cow milk feeding may lead to deficiency in infancy.\n\nNon- pharmacological treatment\n After period of exclusive breastfeeding (6 months), cereal based diet should be added.\n Encourage green leafy vegetables and fruits.\n Treatment depends on hemoglobin levels and age of the patients\nPharmacological treatment- Oral Iron Therapy\n Oral ferrous salts (sulphate, gluconate etc) are the preferred therapeutic iron preparations.\n Therapeutic iron dose: 4 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 2 – 3 divided doses to be given\n between meals for 2 months after normal Hb concentration for age is achieved.\n In prematurity start iron syrup from 2nd week of life to 1 year.\n Response to therapy – decreased irritability and improved appetite is seen within 12 – 24\n hours. Rise in Hb levels seen within 7 days at the rate of 0.25 – 0.4 g/dl/day.\n\n 373",

Genuine\n hard stools may result from an inadequate milk intake, hunger stools, use of overstrength artificial feeds and low roughage diet.\n True constipation may be due to imperforate anus, meconium plug, low intestinal\n obstruction, Hirschsprung's disease, or hypothyroidism but most of the time it is\n idiopathic.\n Symptoms include fretfulness, poor appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, distension.\n Retentive posturing occurs with urge to defaecate, relieved after going to the toilet.\n There may be history of recurrent UTI. Weight gain may be impaired.\n\nNon- pharmacological treatment\n Dietary modification: Ensure adequate fluid intake in diet. In infants, breast milk should\n continue as it is less likely to be constipating than cow's milk, can add extra sugar in\n cow's milk if child is not breast-fed.\n Add fiber by cereals (wheat bran, oat), pulses, vegetables, salads and fruits and isabgol.\n Toilet training to achieve regular evacuation. Child is instructed to use bathroom after\n breakfast or dinner, to take advantage of meal stimulated increase in colonic motility.\n Maintain calendar to record evacuations.\n Positive reinforcement (reward/appreciation) for successful toileting (no punishment for\n failure).\nPharmacological treatment\n Agarol or lactulose in infants 2.5-10 ml/day; children 40-90 ml/day in 3-4\n divided doses. Or mineral oil (liquid paraffin) 5-15 ml/kg/day Or milk of magnesia 0.5-3\n ml/kg/day.

In some\n dehydration child is thirsty and drinks voraciously, active and alert but irritable, with\n sunken eyes, depressed fontanelle, absent tears, loss of skin turgor and some decrease in\n urine output. In severe dehydration all these are more severe except that child is\n lethargic and does not want to drink water.\n\nThe following table lists the investigations that may be done if indication exists.\n Table 9.

    "text": "- Though, diabetics can undertake any exercise, but unusual exercise may require modification\n in insulin dosing. For the schedule day of unusual exercise, insulin dose may be reduced by\n 10-15%.\n Pharmacological treatment\n Initial therapy:\n Treatment is initiated in the hospital with fast acting (regular) insulin. At the onset of DM\n (or after recovery from DKA) the dose of insulin is 0.5-1.0 unit/kg/day.\n Inj. Regular insulin 0.1-0.25 units/kg subcutaneous injections are given 6-8 hourly before\n meals.\n - Simultaneous blood glucose level monitoring is done. One to two days therapy is required\n to find out total daily insulin requirement. Once the patient stabilizes on 6 hourly insulin\n injections, the patient is switched over to \"2 daily injections\" schedule.\n - In \"2 daily injections\" schedule, the insulin is administered as follows:\n Combinations of intermediate acting (usually lente) insulin and fast acting (regular)\n insulin in the ratio of 2-3:1. Two third of total daily -dose is injected before breakfast and\n one third before dinner. Each injection has combination of both types of insulin e.g., total\n dose of insulin is 30 units -20 units (14 units lente and 6 units regular) are injected before\n breakfast and 10 units (6 units lente and 4 units regular) are injected before dinner.\n - Blood glucose levels are monitored before each meal and the dose of insulin adjusted\n accordingly. Blood glucose levels should ideally be 80 mg/dl fasting and 140 mg/dl after\n meals (acceptable range between 80 -240 mg/dl). Early morning 3 AM blood glucose\n level should be more than 70 mg/dl.\n Modification in the insulin doses:\n - Modification in the insulin doses will be required depending upon the blood glucose\n levels. Any increase or decrease in insulin dose is by 10 - 15% (generally not more than 6\n units).\n - After initial stabilization, newly diagnosed cases may have gradual decline in insulin\n requirement even upto 0.5 units/kg/day. This may persist for several weeks to several\n months.\n - Decrease total dose of insulin by 10% at the time of discharge from hospital as the\n increased activity at home will decrease the insulin requirement.\n Assessment of diabetic control or response to therapy\n - Blood glucose estimation should be done before each meal and at bed time in the first few\n weeks after diagnosis. After stabilization, it can be reduced to twice a week.\n - Periodically blood glucose estimation at 3-4 AM is required to detect early morning\n hypoglycaemia.\n - Urine for sugar is also monitored initially 3-4 times daily before meals. Urine for ketones\n once daily should be done.\n\n 398",

Common causes of acquired hypothyroidism are\n iodine deficiency, lymphocytic thyroiditis and following irradiation of cervical region\n for malignant disorders.\n The diagnosis is quite often missed in the initial months; hence neonatal screening is\n important. The diagnosis is based on demonstration of low serum T4. Serum T3 levels\n may be normal and are not useful for diagnosis. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH is\n elevated. Radionuclide scans are not essential for diagnosis but help to delineate the\n exact etiology.\n\n Pharmacological treatment\n Thyroxin treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed by thyroid\n function tests (preferably the same day as the evaluation).\n There remains some controversy regarding the initial starting dose of thyroxin and how\n quickly the Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) should be normalized. A recommended\n starting dose is approximately 10-15 mcg/kg/day.\n The initial dose for first 7 days may be on the higher end (14 mcg/kg/day) and then reduced\n to lower level (10 mcg/kg/day) and then tapered to 5-7 mcg/kg/day by 1st year.\n\n 399",

Sodium valproate is effective but potential risk does not justify\nits use.\nPatient education( parents/care taker)\n Assure the benign nature of the disease with no neurological deficit or mental retardation\n as a result of simple febrile seizure. Teach to control of fever and to give diazepam per\n rectally at home.\n Routine immunization as per schedule should be followed. After DPT vaccination, oral\n paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose every 6 h for 2 or 3 days and similarly, after measles\n vaccination, oral paracetamol in the same dose started on the 4th day from the day of\n vaccination and given for 3 to 4 days to avoid precipitation of febrile seizures.\n\n ACUTE PYOGENIC MENINGITIS (CSF or clinically proven)\nAcute meningitis is an acute inflammatory process involving brain tissue, due to infectious\ncauses. The common aetiological agents are viruses and bacteria. Children of any age may be\naffected.\n Salient features\n Fever, headache, vomiting, irritability, altered state of consciousness, signs of\n meningeal irritation and seizures. CSF examination differentiates the viral from\n bacterial causes.\n\n 407",
